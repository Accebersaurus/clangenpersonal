## Contributing
Clangen is an open-source project, and anyone can contribute to it by making a pull request. Everyone who created a PR which was also merged will get the `developer` role in our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/clangen). Another way for people to join the team is through applying to become an Apprentice Developer to join our projects. Inactive developers (especially Apprentice Devs) may be cleared out from time to time. They are always free to reapply for the position or make a new PR in order to get their roles back, though.
