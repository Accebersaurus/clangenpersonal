Stat Cat doesn't hesitate before splitting from the patrol to check on the source of the noise.

Stat Cat gets quite the scare, but thankfully the crab only wants to get away from him and vanishes back into the grass.
Random takes the lead in checking the source of the noise and comes face to face with an angry fox! Though he backpedals rapidly, the fox still gets its teeth into him before the rest of the patrol can back him up.

A friendly Twoleg makes a psspsspss noise and pours kittypet food on the ground for Random. He's always wondered what it might taste like... Dry, is the answer. Very odd.
Stat Cat gets distracted from hunting by strange Twoleg activity around one of their dens. They appear to be hauling all their many, many varieties of nest lining out and into a big monster. Stat Cat takes the opportunity to grab a little soft thing, something almost shaped like prey. It'll be good for the nursery.
Calmly, Stat Cat weaves around the Twoleg dens, picking out the mice from the tunnels and the birds off the strange metal hanging fruit. A successful, sneaky hunt.

Success
Darting through quickly, he sees that the lovely smell is Twoleg mush and keeps running.
The lovely smell leads to Twoleg mush. Puzzled, Random checks around himself. His fur stands on end as he realizes he's standing in a metal tunnel, cloaked in rust and camouflage. It's to his great fortune that this trap seems to be broken, but whatever Twoleg restocked the bait might still be around. He leaves quickly.
Something about this situation sets all of Stat Cat's instincts off. He investigates carefully and strips the cover of the sand away from a Twoleg trap underneath.
Something isn't right. Nervously pawing at the sand, Stat Cat thinks that the smell is too good to be true. He leaves it, deciding to return to camp and report it to the deputy instead.

As the patrol passes a series of shallow rockpools, they spot a small octopus trapped by the tide.

Success
Random expertly flips the octopus out of its refuge and dispatches it with a quick bite. One for the fresh-kill pile!
This rockpool proves to be a good fishing ground, and as well as the octopus, the patrol pulls crabs and limpets out from where the tides have left them.
The octopus sees the cats and vanishes into a crevice, but Stat Cat is able to lever it out with a thin strip of driftwood.
Stat Cat pounces on the octopus enthusiastically. It thwacks its tentacles around his head, trying to avoid his snapping muzzle, but Stat Cat takes it in stride, prancing out of the rockpool to cheers and hilarity from the patrol, letting his friends guide him and his semi-captured prey blindly back to camp as everyone murrps with laughter.

Random pounces, feeling almost sorry for the sea creature, which is too small to put up much of a fight.
The cats watch the roiling, uncoordinated, twisting mass of limbs, completely weirded out. The small octopus is almost to the sea before someone thinks to catch the thing. It's not a slick hunt - more of a scramble.

-
Success
The patrol pounces in a coordinated strike on the massive potential prey - but this prey has more arms than there are cats, and it takes all their energy to wrestle with the titanically strong long arms. The patrol takes a couple hours to rest afterwards before they try moving it, and in the end, they almost lose the octopus' body to the tides.
Stat Cat coordinates the cats, and they all work together, distracting the octopus while another member of the patrol grabs an appendage and hauls it backwards. Through repeated short jerks and avoiding its snapping beak, they manage to drag the octopus away from the ocean. Then it's just a matter of time before it dies.
With a cool head under very odd circumstances, Stat Cat keeps the patrol focused on the prey opportunity and not how weird the whole thing is. The octopus is a creature so large that if it were in the water, the patrol would never have a chance, but on land and working together, they take it down.

Fail
The cats watch the roiling, uncoordinated, twisting mass of limbs, completely weirded out. Random darts in to try and catch it, but one long tentacle lazily smacks him back. Even on land, this octopus seems too big to tackle.
Confronted with the roiling mass of flesh, Stat Cat panics and is no help as the patrol tries to decide what to do. In the end, the octopus slithers into the ocean and disappears.
Random pounces, trying to end the weird encounter quickly, but a tentacle grabs him and hauls him closer, revealing a massive, hooked beak. With Random yowling and wriggling and a complete lack of bones to hold itself up, the octopus only manages to take a small chunk out of him, but it's enough to make the patrol back off.
Stat Cat dances around nervously, but the patrol wants to give this hunt a try. His anxiety doesn't help, and the deflated octopus manages to grab and bite him with its hooked beak - maybe Stat Cat was right to be cautious.

Success
The patrol uses the eagle as a scout for their own hunt and makes several smaller catches from the same area, which cumulatively are just as impressive as the eagle's massive catch.
The cats' eyes light up with possibility, watching the eagle swimming to shore awkwardly. Patrol Lead leads the patrol in yowling threats and insults from the shoreline, making a massive racket. Bewildered, the eagle gives up its catch and takes to the air. The massive fish washes ashore into the paws of the patrol.
As the rest of the patrol discusses whether they can steal the catch, Stat Cat fixates on the bird that caught it. The eagle works its way awkwardly towards shore, and just as it's going to climb out, Stat Cat pounces, fighting in the shallows where Stat Cat has the edge over the bird in swimming.

Success
While a gray fox is bigger and stockier than the cats, the delicious stench of whatever-it-is makes the patrol's eyes go wide, and they leap to claim possession of it. Outnumbered and already full of stinky nonsense, the gray fox leaves the beach, scrambling up a cliff as the cats give in to instinct and roll around in the glorious smell.
A gray fox is bigger than them, yes... but only just, and that carcass smells divine. The cats creep up on the fox, using the dunes for cover, and wait until the fox has its head buried in the carcass to attack. The ambush sends the competing predator fleeing and leaves the cats to claim the blissfully stinky food.
Stat Cat shows his strength, leading the fight against the gray fox. By working together and keeping it distracted, the cats harry and harass the fox until it gives up and runs.
The patrol launches into battle, but with so few cats, it's exhausting trying to keep the fox and its snapping jaws on the defensive. In an act of daring bravery, Stat Cat darts low to the ground, gets under its snout, and sinks his teeth into the fox's throat. It's only one bite, but the fox has had enough and flees.
-
Fail
The patrol fails to drive away the fox, which keeps possession of the food. However, there were no injuries.
Stat Cat makes a stupid mistake, too intent on winning the fight to respect his enemy's teeth, and it's only being yanked back by the tail that saves him from injury. The patrol gives up and settles down to wait a safe distance away until the fox leaves of its own accord.
Stat Cat means well, but he's overconfident in his attack, and the fox manages to sink its teeth into him. The patrol is forced to retreat, forming a defensive ring around the wounded Stat Cat.

Success
Patrol Lead leads the patrol to the end of the scent trail, where a red fox sits plucking the feathers off a plump seagull. With careful signals, the cats set up an ambush. There aren't many of them, but the fox doesn't need to know that - with a massive explosion of yowls, the cats sound like a full battle patrol, and the fox yips with fear as the cats pounce to take possession of the bird.
They're a small patrol but a skilled one. When they track down the red fox at the end of the scent trail, they have enough skill and muscle to drive it off from the fish it was gnawing on. The cats gather around the prey, congratulating each other.
Stat Cat reminds the rest of the patrol that things don't always need to end in a fight. Following the trail, they uncover a food cache of dead fish buried in a dune. They still don't know what kind of fox left the trail, and they don't need to - these fish will make great additions to the fresh-kill pile back home.

When Random spots the red fox he's tracked dipping into a sheltered cove, he hangs back. He sneaks around until he sees the fox burying a fish for later. He simply waits for it to finish and leave, then creeps in to steal the fox's hard work, bringing the prize back to camp for the fresh-kill pile. Sometimes winning a battle doesn't require fighting.
Stat Cat uses some of his best tricks to sneaks close to the red fox at the end of the scent trail, his eyes on the fish the fox carries.

It's a good prize, and he feels proud to present it to the elders when he pads into camp, tired but satisfied.
It's a situation that calls for careful, deliberate action. Stat Cat tracks down a red fox at the end of the scent trail, holding a young seagull, and waits.

-
Success
The patrol makes short work of locating the squirrels, spreading out into a loose formation to encircle their prey. Slowly, they move in, the circle getting tighter and tighter, until they're finally seen. The squirrels screech and scatter in different directions, but the circle cuts off their escape, and by the end of it they're fresh-kill.
First order of business is blocking their access to any nearby burrows, which Random takes care of. After that, it's a matter of finding and catching the squirrels, which proves to be simple, especially with their access to safety denied. One really couldn't ask for a better hunt.
Stat Cat murmurs instructions to his Clanmates, who nod silently and move into position. One cat feints at a squirrel, who raises the alarm and turns to run; another cat blocks off the nearby burrow's entrance, forcing the squirrels to run towards Stat Cat; and Stat Cat lunges in for the kill. A flawless hunt, with not a single squirrel left behind.

It only takes one squirrel spotting Random to raise the alarm before they've all vanished into their burrows. Though the others made a few catches before they scattered, they didn't get nearly what they would have otherwise.

The patrol catches the scent of a fox - but is it red or gray?
-
Success
The red vixen smells of milk and blood. Hopefully by driving her out of the territory, the litter she has been raising this greenleaf won't be a threat to the Clan.
Stat Cat displays incredible skill, driving the mother vixen and her brood off of the coast all by himself. Now neither the red fox nor her dependent cubs pose a threat to the Clan. He swells with pride, feeling the confidence of knowing that he's truly one of the best fighters c_n has ever produced.
A brilliant battle move by Stat Cat at a critical moment knocks the red vixen off balance, and Stat Cat manages to drive her out of c_n territory, though it takes every spark of strength in his pelt to do it alone.
-
Fail
Never threaten a mother's young - the red vixen kills Random in the skirmish and carries off the body to feed her litter.
The mother red fox's snapping jaws leave Random dripping blood on the sand and barely able to escape further injury.
Stat Cat is determined to win, but the red vixen is determined to live, and that makes all the difference. Stat Cat ends up pinned in a defensible hiding spot, bleeding and terrified, until the vixen judges him no longer a threat and continues on her way.

bch_hunt_grayvixen4

The patrol catches the scent of a fox - but is it red or gray?
-
Success
The stocky gray vixen they track down smells of milk, and though she's nearly double the weight of any of the patrol and all of it muscle, they meet her eyes squarely and leap to attack. c_n does not tolerate sharing their territory with foxes, and they work together to drive her off.
The patrol drives away the gray fox, seeks out her den, and kills her young cubs. It's brutal, but these fluffy small foxes would one day have grown to be kit-killers and thieves. Better to deal with them now rather than when they're the same height as and nearly double the weight of a cat, though a gray fox will always be easier to fight than a bigger red one.
Stat Cat displays incredible skill, driving the mother vixen out of the territory almost by himself. Now neither the gray fox nor her cubs pose a threat to the Clan. It places Stat Cat as one of c_n's most talented and skillful fighters; a gray fox is a dangerous competitor.
The patrol overcomes the gray vixen they find and drives her off thanks to a brilliant battle move by Stat Cat. The cats swirl around Stat Cat afterwards, congratulating him on his bravery and skill.
-
Fail
The patrol comes across a gray vixen at the end of the scent trail. She spots them too, measures herself up against them, then flees, scrambling up the cliffs of the headland in a move that completely surprises the cats. This round goes to the gray fox.
Stat Cat is determined to win, but his confidence is misplaced. He's a good fighter but not a great one, and in a moment that embarrasses him deeply, the gray vixen slips past him and flees into the maze of the sand dunes.
The patrol finds a stocky gray vixen wandering their coast and drives her out in a scene that mostly involves yowling and screaming and yapping at each other, until she gives in. Random gets a little battered, but everyone is mostly fine.
Stat Cat is determined to win, but his confidence is misplaced. He's a good fighter but not a great one, and the stocky gray vixen is all muscle, barging past Stat Cat and knocking him rump over paws as she flees from the patrol.

The patrol catches the scent of a fox - but is it red or gray?
-
Success
Led by Patrol Lead and with a heap of cooperation and teamwork, the patrol drives away the gray fox, seeks out her den, and kills her growing cubs. The coast will be safe from both the competition the vixen posed this season, and the threat her cubs would have been to c_n in the seasons to come.
With so many cats working together in tight coordination, they're able to keep the gray vixen they find pinned and distracted as they wear her down. The fox eventually flees for her den, and the patrol follows to take care of the cubs she's raising.
Stat Cat displays incredible skill, driving the mother vixen out of the territory almost by himself. Now neither the gray fox nor her cubs pose a threat to the Clan. It places Stat Cat as one of c_n's most talented and skillful fighters; a gray fox is a dangerous competitor.
Bravely, Stat Cat charges the gray fox, yowling threats. The vixen spooks and skitters up a tree, growling and barking in a squeaky tone, and Stat Cat follows her up into the branches. As the rest of the patrol backs them up from the ground, Stat Cat screams until the fox is cowering and afraid, then lets her flee.

As the patrol arrives at a beach, they spot Twolegs and their kits lounging around a brightly colored pelt of some kind, surrounded by a tempting food-scent.
-
Success
The patrol sneaks closer. It seems the Twolegs are eating, though the open beach shore means the cats don't have any chance of stealing a bite.
Stat Cat is more interested in the strangely-colored pelt than the food-scent, which the Twolegs will undoubtedly be possessive of. He wonders how the odd creatures make such things, and why on earth they'd bring them to a beach to sit on pointlessly.
-

The patrol can't seem to interpret the purpose of the Gathering. Twolegs are just mystifying.
As the patrol gets close, a Twoleg kit runs at them, screaming unintelligibly. While running away, Random sprains a leg.

Success
One Paw misses a b_tp_a_s, and Two Paw startles a pair of b_tp_a_p. They don't let it get them down, instead capturing a plump rabbit with a beautiful team ambush! But when they bring it back to camp, One Paw tries to take sole credit for the prey, and instead of familial talent, it's familial discord that's displayed, as the apprentices get into a massive argument in the middle of camp.
Stat Cat catches a great b_mp_a_s, and two b_tp_dl_p! But his sibling comes up empty-pawed. Stat Cat offers to let him claim the smaller prey as his own, but the insulting suggestion just causes a massive argument.

Fail
The littermates end up dirty, exhausted, and without much more than a b_tp_dl_s to show for it. Fox-dung! But at least out here, even if they didn't get much prey, they can complain about how stupidly hard hunting is to a sympathetic audience.
One Paw takes a hard fall while swiping at a b_mp_a_s in a sharply decorated rockpool, and the afternoon's hunt is called off as her sibling helps her back to camp, chatting reassuringly about how hard their hunting lessons are.

It's nice to get the chance to go out hunting with Two Paw. One Paw knows they're still in the apprentice den together, but with their different mentors and focuses and skills - it's not the same as it was back in the nursery as littermates. And the greenleaf sun is so warm and bright!
-
Success
Yeah, it's a relatively okay hunt, with a couple b_tp_dl_p and a dirty b_tp_dl_s. But what One Paw is actually going to remember about today is that Two Paw thinks that his mentor and One Paw's would make a cute couple!
It turns out Stat Cat has really been listening to his mentor's tips for hunting - and he's willing to pass it on!
-
Fail
Together they manage a grand haul of one b_tp_dl_s, and not even a very big b_tp_dl_s at that. They have a lot more to learn before they'll all be ready to take on the responsibility of providing for c_n.

The sun is out, (again) the seagulls are squabbling, (it's been constant lately), there's not a breath of wind (time to go fishing and dip their paws in the rockpools) and Patrol Lead is out on a hunting patrol with Random.
-
Success
A b_mp_a_s and two b_tp_a_p is nothing to sniff at, as a hunting success, but stars above, being alone with Random makes Patrol Lead feel like a kitten again. And not in the cute way either - in the chewing on tails, whiny, petty, immature way. Ugh.
The hunting patrol is perfectly successful, and it matters not a whit to either of the warriors, because Patrol Lead makes a joke that she thinks is funny but that's always gotten on Random's nerves, and suddenly they're both acting like apprentices again - snippy, immature, and irritable.
Stat Cat nets them two healthy b_mp_a_p to take back to camp, but it only irritates his sibling. Random never even got the chance to even try for a swipe, is he only there to carry around Stat Cat's prey?

A scruffy b_mp_dl_s, a bundle of b_tp_a_p, and a patrol spent retreading all their favorite in-jokes - it's a good day.
There's just something nice about hanging out with another warrior who'll always be there for him, regardless of their similarities and differences. And they also bring back a good-sized b_mp_a_s with some b_tp_dl_p on the side for the fresh-kill pile.
Random is proud of Stat Cat, watching him dart among the waves, foam bubbling along his pelt.

Watching Random execute a fantastic leap to bring down a b_mp_dl_s, Patrol Lead smiles. Does Random remember the time he tried to do that as a kitten and stood on his own tail? The siblings laugh about it as they move on to the next hunting ground.
It's been a while since they've been on a patrol alone together, and after they catch a couple b_mp_dl_p for the fresh-kill pile, Random spends a bit just chasing Patrol Lead around the seashore, batting at each other in a moment of silliness.
Random jokes that he can't possibly be related to Stat Cat - clearly Stat Cat was born from reef sharks, not cats, with the way he glides through the water.
-
Fail
Sometimes, the prey just doesn't run, and today is one of those times.
Random sees a fish he'd like for the fresh-kill pile, but while perched on a rock setting up a good pounce, a rogue wave washes them into the ocean. He bobs to the surface and splutter his way to shore, but his breath comes short and wheezing after the dunking. Fleas and ticks!

Patrol Lead grabs a massive b_mp_dl_s that she can barely carry, and Random congratulates her, secretly wondering if he'll ever manage to surpass his sibling's achievements.

The siblings head out to one of the further hunting grounds of the beach, where a long series of shallow rock pools promises good hunting and a way to cool off.
-
Success
Together, they collect a b_tp_a_s, a couple b_tp_a_p, and an old b_mp_a_s. It should be a great patrol, returning with so much prey - but Random is acting obnoxious, and his sibling has little time or patience for it.
Random makes a dumb comment that accidentally cuts deep. His sibling works with him long enough to bring back a decent haul of prey - but no longer.
-
Fail
Today is just not their day.
The patrol tries to hunt, but Random keeps stopping to duck behind bushes, until it's obvious that something is actually wrong. Eww.

The sun is out, (again) the seagulls are squabbling, (it's been constant lately), there's not a breath of wind (time to go fishing and dip their paws in the rockpools) and Patrol Lead is out on a hunting patrol with their siblings.
-
Success
A b_mp_a_s and a couple b_mp_a_p are nothing to sniff at, as a hunting success, but stars above, being alone with her siblings makes Patrol Lead feel like a kitten again. And not in the cute way either - in the chewing on tails, whiny, petty, immature way. Ugh.
The hunting patrol is perfectly successful and it matters not a whit to any of the warriors, because Patrol Lead makes a joke that she thinks is funny but that's always gotten on Random's nerves, and suddenly everyone's acting like apprentices again - snippy, immature, and irritable.
Stat Cat nets them four healthy b_mp_a_p to take back to camp, but it only irritates his siblings. Random never even got the chance to even try for a swipe. Is he only there to carry around Stat Cat's prey?
-
Fail
It isn't a very successful hunt - they'll have to head out again for more soon.

bch_hunt_random_greenleaf_siblings3to6warriorslocked2

Sometimes, it's just nice to hang out with his siblings. Especially when the water's pleasantly cool on their overheated pelts, perfect for a great hunt together!
-
Success
A scruffy b_mp_dl_s, a bundle of b_tp_a_p, and a patrol spent retreading all their favorite in-jokes - it's a good day.
There's just something nice about hanging out with other warriors who'll always be there for him, regardless of their similarities and differences. And they also bring back a good-sized b_mp_a_s with some b_tp_dl_p on the side for the fresh-kill pile.
The siblings are proud of Stat Cat, watching him dart among the waves, foam bubbling along his pelt.
-
Fail
They don't manage anything like the number of catches they were all expecting to get - a bit disappointing, even if they're not entirely empty-pawed.

bch_hunt_random_greenleaf_siblings3to6warriorslocked3

Sun's out, and Random has been assigned a moderately tolerable hunting patrol - his siblings!
-
Success
Watching Random execute a fantastic leap to bring down a b_mp_dl_s, Patrol Lead smiles. Does Random remember the time he tried to do that as a kitten and stood on his own tail? The siblings laugh about it together as they move on to the next hunting ground.
It's been a while since they've been on a patrol alone together, and after they catch a couple b_mp_a_p and a b_mp_a_s for the fresh-kill pile, Random spends a bit just chasing their siblings around the seashore, batting at each other in a moment of silliness.
Random jokes that he can't possibly be related to Stat Cat - clearly Stat Cat was born from reef sharks, not cats, with the way he glides through the water.
-
Fail
Sometimes, the prey just doesn't run, and today is one of those times.
Random sees a fish he'd like for the fresh-kill pile, but while perched on a rock setting up a good pounce, a rogue wave washes them into the ocean. He bobs to the surface and splutter his way to shore, but his breath comes short and wheezing after the dunking. Fleas and ticks!

bch_hunt_herb_warriorgreenleaf1

Patrol Lead finds a patch of herbs that she believe c_n might need for their stores. She freely admit to her patrol she isn't a medicine cat and ask her companions' advice. What do they know about this part of the coast's herbal properties, especially in the heat of greenleaf?
-
Success
It's not their normal task, but they're all smart enough to value supporting the Clan's medicine den. The patrol brings the herbs back to camp, and they are put to good use.
Stat Cat carefully plucks some of the herbs and takes them back to the camp to be identified before the patrol goes to the trouble of collecting them, smartly deciding to get an informed opinion before committing the patrol.
-
Fail
The patrol brings the herbs back to camp, only to find out that while the herbs promote good gut health, they're not a rare resource. Still, c_n will be eating an extra healthy dinner tonight with the herbs sprinkled into their freshkill.

bch_hunt_leaf-bare_solosquirrel1

Patrol Lead stalks low to the ground, paws soft and light so as not to make a sound. Her jaws hang open to taste at the air, and a tingle of satisfaction shoots through her as she scents a nearby ground squirrel, scrounging in the sand for its stashed-away food.
-
Success
The wind shifts, but before the squirrel can react, Patrol Lead acts fast and leaps, stopping it from shrieking an alarm call with a quick nip to the back of the neck.
The squirrel doesn't notice Patrol Lead stalking up to them... that is, until she's already pounced and has it between her jaws. It's a little late to do anything about it at that point, though.
The squirrel blissfully snuffles around in the sand, completely unaware of the looming danger it's in. Stat Cat stalks, as quiet as a shadow, and doesn't even need to pounce; he just walks right up behind it and makes the kill.
-
Fail
The wind shifts, and the squirrel stiffens, shrieks out an alarm call, and vanishes back into its burrow. Oh well.

bch_hunt_leaf-bare_soloappsquirrel1

One Paw has snuck out of camp alone, hoping she'll find a nice fat ground squirrel. Running through everything she's been taught in her head, she carefully scents the air and strains her ears, hoping for any hint of the burrowing critters in the stony outcrop they like to nest in.
-
Success
The wind blows a scent towards them, and One Paw immediately drops into a crouch. She tracks it down to a shallow burrow; when she shimmies her head and shoulders inside, she finds a sleeping squirrel! It's an easy kill and a good meal for someone at camp.
One Paw walks in circles for a bit and is about to give up and go home, when she nearly trips over a ground squirrel burrow. A chitter from within gets her excited, and she thrusts a paw into the entrance and yanks a squirrel out!

Unfortunately, she doesn't end up finding anything, and she slinks back to camp empty-pawed.

bch_hunt_leaf-bare_mentorsquirrel1

Patrol Lead and One Paw sit on the beach, near a network of ground squirrel burrows hidden in the stones. This is one of a few such networks, rotated around by mentors to teach apprentices their hunting skills. One Paw scents the air as instructed and points out a burrow; sure enough, there's a squirrel's head poking out the entrance!
-
Success
Patrol Lead praises her and smiles, and One Paw drops into a hunting crouch as the squirrel crawls out of the burrow. Though her paws are rather unpracticed, the basic knowledge is solid, and her hunt is a success!

bch_hunt_leaf-bare_squirrel_rattlesnakerumble1

As the patrol walks through the sandy beaches of their territory, a low sound kicks up just at the edges of their hearing. Patrol Lead comes to an abrupt stop and scrambles backwards, hissing at the others to stop as well, once they realize what's making it - there's a rattlesnake, staring down a ground squirrel!
-
Success
Watching from a careful distance, the patrol observes the squirrel chittering at it, kicking up sand and wildly whipping its tail in the air. The snake backs up and hisses, before turning and slithering away. Random wastes no time in pouncing on the squirrel now that it's safe to approach, securing the meal for the Clan!
Watching from a careful distance, the patrol observes the squirrel chittering at it, kicking up sand and wildly whipping its tail in the air. The snake backs up and hisses, and the squirrel lunges!

Patrol Lead's patrol strolls leisurely along the coastline, careful to avoid the chilly spray of the waves. One cat raises their tail, signaling for the others to be still; they've scented ground squirrels nearby.
-
Success
The patrol makes short work of locating the squirrels, spreading out into a loose formation to encircle their prey. Slowly, they move in, the circle getting tighter and tighter, until they're finally seen. The squirrels screech and scatter in different directions, but the circle cuts off their escape, and by the end of it they're fresh-kill.
First order of business is blocking their access to any nearby burrows, which Random takes care of. After that, it's a matter of finding and catching the squirrels, which proves to be simple, especially with their access to safety denied. One really couldn't ask for a better hunt.
Stat Cat murmurs instructions to his Clanmates, who nod silently and move into position. One cat feints at a squirrel, who raises the alarm and turns to run; another cat blocks off the nearby burrow's entrance, forcing the squirrels to run towards Stat Cat; and Stat Cat lunges in for the kill. A flawless hunt, with not a single squirrel left behind.
-
Fail
It only takes one squirrel spotting Random to raise the alarm before they've all vanished into their burrows. Though the others made a few catches before they scattered, they didn't get nearly what they would have otherwise.

bch_hunt_leafbaresnowstorm1

It starts snowing soon after the patrol sets out, trying to bring back something nice for the fresh-kill pile.
-
Success
Despite the snow, the patrol manages to hunt successfully, finding crabs running about on the beach, oblivious to leaf-bare. With the sea to provide, there's more than enough to bring a good haul back to c_n, and as Patrol Lead leads them home, a sense of security and competence drives them onwards.
Everyone looks admiringly at Stat Cat by the end of the afternoon. Every cat carries something home, but nearly all of it was caught by Stat Cat.
Stat Cat really keeps the patrol on task and motivated through the sharp cold of the leaf-bare morning, not through authority or commands, but with a gentle voice and compassionate understanding that encourages every cat to do their best for c_n.
-
Fail
The prey must be hiding; the patrol catches nothing. As a snowstorm descends and visibility drops, the patrol retreats to a sea cave, their pelts and tails and legs all tightly wrapped into one indistinguishable kitty cat ball while they wait for the storm to blow over.

Success
One Paw misses a b_tp_a_s, and Two Paw startles a pair of b_tp_a_p. They don't let it get them down, instead capturing a plump rabbit with a beautiful team ambush! But when they bring it back to camp, One Paw tries to take sole credit for the prey, and instead of familial talent, it's familial discord that's displayed as the apprentices get into a massive argument in the middle of camp.
Stat Cat catches a great b_mp_a_s, and two b_tp_dl_p! But his sibling comes up empty-pawed. Stat Cat offers to let him claim the smaller prey as his own, but the insulting suggestion just causes a massive argument.

Fail
The littermates end up dirty, exhausted, and without much more than a b_tp_a_s to show for it. Fox-dung! But at least out here, even if they didn't get much prey, they can complain about how stupidly hard hunting is to a sympathetic audience.
One Paw takes a hard fall while swiping at a b_mp_a_s in a sharply decorated rockpool, and the afternoon's hunt is called off as her sibling helps her back to camp, chatting reassuringly about how hard their hunting lessons are.

It's nice to get the chance to go out hunting with Two Paw. One Paw knows they're still in the apprentice den together, but with their different mentors and focuses and skills - it's not the same as it was back in the nursery as littermates. Even the cold sting of the wind whipping up off the sea can't dampen their enthusiasm.
-
Success
Yeah, it's a relatively okay hunt, with a couple b_tp_a_p and a dirty b_tp_dl_s. But what One Paw is actually going to remember about today is that Two Paw thinks that his mentor and One Paw's would make a cute couple!
It turns out Stat Cat has really been listening to his mentor's tips for hunting - and he's willing to pass it on!
-
Fail
Together they manage a grand haul of one b_tp_dl_s, and not even a very big b_tp_dl_s at that. They have a lot more to learn before they'll all be ready to take on the responsibility of providing for c_n.

It's nice to get the chance to go out hunting together. One Paw knows they're all still in the apprentice den together, but with their different mentors and focuses and skills - it's not the same as it was back in the nursery with her littermates. Even the cold sting of the wind whipping up off the sea can't dampen their enthusiasm.
-
Success
Yeah, it's a relatively okay hunt, with a couple b_tp_a_p and a dirty b_tp_dl_s. But what One Paw is actually going to remember about today is that Two Paw thinks that his mentor and Three Paw's would make a cute couple!
It turns out Stat Cat has really been listening to his mentor's tips for hunting - and he's willing to pass it on!
-
Fail
Together they manage a grand haul of one b_tp_dl_s, and not even a very big b_tp_dl_s at that. They have a lot more to learn before they'll all be ready to take on the responsibility of providing for c_n.

The clouds hog the sky, weakly trying to threaten snow the way they've done constantly the last few days. And just like the clouds, One Paw and her littermates are everywhere today, sticking their heads into every unexplored corner of the territory. All in the name of hunting, of course!
-
Success
One Paw thinks Two Paw's b_tp_a_s looks infinitely more delicious than her own contributions of two b_tp_dl_p, while Three Paw insists that she'd much rather bring back b_tp_dl_p than the b_mp_dl_s she caught.
Stat Cat spends half the patrol in the heavy waves of the tidal zone, both impressing and frustrating the siblings trying to keep up with him. Plus, everyone has to dry Stat Cat off and warm him up afterwards.
-
Fail
Well, they have a lot of fun exploring, even if it's not that productive of a hunting patrol.

One Paw suppresses a yawn, trying not to make a weird expression in front of Patrol Lead as she do. Patrol Lead suggested this as sibling bonding time, but did they <i>really</i> have to get up at dawn? Leaf-bare is already too cold; no one needs to make it worse with dawn patrols.
-
Success
One Paw collects two b_tp_dl_p, and watches Patrol Lead take down a b_mp_a_s in an astonishing pounce. She's about to trot up to Patrol Lead to express admiration over the kill when Patrol Lead turns around and compliments One Paw's b_tp_dl_p, making One Paw grimace at what's got to be fake praise.
Watching Stat Cat's displays of athleticism makes One Paw feel small - surely she'll never be able to do that?

As they wander along the coastline, keeping further back from the shore least the spray steal heat from their pelts, Patrol Lead awkwardly asks One Paw how she think her training is going.
-
Success
Giving in and accepting that she's just going to look stupid in front of her cool older sibling, One Paw tells Patrol Lead about the trouble she's been having with her pounce. It's such a simple thing - she should have it by now! But Patrol Lead is actually super helpful and reassuring about it; it's nice.
Because, you see, if One Paw ever wanted help - Stat Cat knows they're not littermates, but they're still siblings. Stat Cat is totally here for her if One Paw ever wants extra training. It's still an awkward offer. But it's nice.

One Paw doesn't want to talk about it. Like. At all. She stalks off in a huff.

One Paw knows her patrol is still bringing back a little prey for the fresh-kill pile, but... it's so disappointing. She really wanted to prove how much she's grown to Patrol Lead.

As the rockpools sheen their edges with frost, and the spray from the ocean tries to leech all the heat from their pelts, Patrol Lead is out on a hunting patrol with Random.
-
Success
Three b_tp_dl_p are nothing to sniff at in leaf-bare as a hunting success, but stars above, being alone with Random makes Patrol Lead feel like a kitten again. And not in the cute way either - in the chewing on tails, whiny, petty, immature way. Ugh.
The hunting patrol isn't very successful, yet it matters not a whit to either of the warriors, because Patrol Lead makes a joke that she thinks is funny but that's always gotten on Random's nerves, and suddenly they're both acting like apprentices again - snippy, immature, and irritable.
Stat Cat nets them a healthy b_mp_a_s to take back to camp, but it only irritates his sibling. Random never even got the chance to even try for a pounce. Is he only there to carry around Stat Cat's prey?
-
Fail
It isn't a very successful hunt - they'll have to head out again for more soon.
Perhaps hunting from the sides of a slippery, frosty rock pool wasn't their best moment, Random concedes. The patrol has to hurry back to camp to warm him up.

Sometimes, it's just nice to hang out with his sibling. Especially when the weather has kept them in camp too often recently!
-
Success
A sandy b_tp_dl_s, a bundle of b_tp_a_p, and a patrol spent retreading all their favorite in-jokes - it's a good day.
There's just something nice about hanging out with another warrior who'll always be there for him, regardless of their similarities and differences. And they also bring back a good-sized b_mp_dl_s with some b_tp_a_p on the side for the fresh-kill pile.
The siblings are proud of Stat Cat, watching him dart among the waves, foam bubbling along his pelt. Though sharing tongues afterwards is necessary to warm up again.

They don't manage anything like the number of catches they were both expecting to get - a bit disappointing, even if they're not entirely empty-pawed.

Sun's out, weakly shining, and Random has been assigned a moderately tolerable hunting partner - his sibling!
-
Success
Watching Random execute a fantastic leap to bring down a b_mp_a_s, Patrol Lead smiles. Does Random remember the time he tried to do that as a kitten and stood on his own tail? The siblings laugh about it as they move on to the next hunting ground.
It's been a while since they've been on a patrol alone together, and after they catch two b_mp_dl_p for the fresh-kill pile, Random spends a bit just chasing Patrol Lead along the shoreline, batting at each other in a moment of silliness.
Random jokes that he can't possibly be related to Stat Cat - clearly Stat Cat was born from reef sharks, not cats, with the way he glides through the water.
-
Fail
Sometimes, the prey just doesn't run, and today is one of those times.
Random sees a fish he'd like for the fresh-kill pile, but while perched on a rock setting up a good pounce, a rogue wave washes them into the ocean. He bobs to the surface and splutter his way to shore, but his breath comes short and wheezing after the freezing dunking. Fleas and ticks!

Success
Together, they collect a couple b_tp_dl_p and an old b_mp_dl_s. It should be a great patrol, returning with reasonable prey in the harsh season - but Random is acting obnoxious and his sibling has little time or patience for it.
Random makes a dumb comment that accidentally cuts deep. His sibling works with him long enough to bring back sufficient prey - but no longer.

Today is just not their day.
The patrol tries to hunt, but Random keeps stopping to duck behind bushes, until it's obvious that something is actually wrong. Eww.

Patrol Lead stalks low to the ground, paws soft and light so as not to make a sound. Her jaws hang open to taste at the air, and a tingle of satisfaction shoots through her as she scents a nearby ground squirrel, fat in preparation for leaf-bare.
-
Success
The wind shifts, but before the squirrel can react Patrol Lead acts fast and leaps, stopping it from shrieking an alarm call with a quick nip to the back of the neck.
The squirrel doesn't notice Patrol Lead stalking up to them... that is, until she's already pounced and has it between her jaws. It's a little late to do anything about it at that point, though.
The squirrel blissfully snuffles around in the sand, completely unaware of the looming danger it's in. Stat Cat stalks, as quiet as a shadow, and doesn't even need to pounce; he just walks right up behind it and makes the kill.

Success
The wind blows a scent towards her, and One Paw immediately drops into a crouch. It's hard to locate in the maze of stones, and she's pretty sure at one point it's long gone, but in the end she finds and catches it!

As the patrol walks through the sandy beaches of their territory, a low sound kicks up just at the edges of their hearing. Patrol Lead comes to an abrupt stop and scrambles backwards, hissing at the others to stop as well, once she realizes what's making it - there's a rattlesnake, staring down a ground squirrel!
-
Success
Watching from a careful distance, the patrol observes the squirrel chittering at it, kicking up sand and wildly whipping its tail in the air. The snake backs up and hisses, before turning and slithering away. Random wastes no time in pouncing on the squirrel now that it's safe to approach, securing the meal for the Clan!

Patrol Lead's patrol strolls leisurely along the coastline, enjoying the chill of the leaf-fall wind. One cat raises their tail, signaling for the others to be still; they've scented ground squirrels nearby.
-
Success
The patrol makes short work of locating the squirrels, spreading out into a loose formation to encircle their prey. Slowly, they move in, the circle getting tighter and tighter, until they're finally seen. The squirrels screech and scatter in different directions, but the circle cuts off their escape, and by the end of it they're fresh-kill.
First order of business is blocking their access to any nearby burrows, which Random takes care of. After that, it's a matter of finding and catching the squirrels, which proves to be simple, especially with their access to safety denied. One really couldn't ask for a better hunt.
Stat Cat murmurs instructions to his Clanmates, who nod silently and move into position. One cat feints at a squirrel, who raises the alarm and turns to run; another cat blocks off the nearby burrow's entrance, forcing the squirrels to run towards Stat Cat; and Stat Cat lunges in for the kill. A flawless hunt, with not a single squirrel left behind.

It only takes one squirrel spotting Random to raise the alarm before they've all vanished into their burrows. Though the others made a few catches before they scattered, they didn't get nearly what they would have otherwise.

They're nearly of equal height, with Stat Cat's bold aggression making up for the weight that the gray vixen has on him, and the standoff is resolved when Stat Cat charges the gray fox and she chooses flight over fight.

Random comes across a gray vixen at the end of the scent trail. She spots him too, measures herself up against him, then flees, scrambling up the cliffs of the headland in a move that completely surprises Random. This round goes to the gray fox.
Stat Cat is determined to win, but his confidence is misplaced. He's a good fighter but not a great one, and in a moment that embarrasses him deeply, the gray vixen slips past him and flees into the maze of the sand dunes.
Random nearly managed to pin the gray vixen he finds on a cliff ledge, but snapping jaws leave Random dripping blood on the sand. Today, this round goes to the gray fox.
Stat Cat is determined to win, but his confidence is misplaced. He's a good fighter but not a great one, and the stocky gray vixen is cunning, sinking her teeth into Stat Cat to distract him as she flees.

A sudden gust of wind and rain hits the patrol. They were wrong about the weather and are now soaking wet.
-
Success
Patrol Lead and her patrol decide to leave the beach behind and find some trees under which to shelter. It turns out to be a stroke of luck, as many of the prey have also decided to seek shelter from the pouring rain. They catch many small prey, and they end up going back to camp soaked anyway but successful.
Patrol Lead knows of a spot where they can shelter in between some bushes and wait out the rain. Random suddenly inhales sharply and directs his attention to a small nest full of baby birds who have fallen from a tree because of the wind. They are wet but happy; now they can return to camp with their heads held high and rest happily and hopefully warm in their nests later that day, knowing they have fed their Clan.
-
Fail
Patrol Lead and Random end up arguing about whether or not to continue the patrol. Nobody is happy after they decide to go back to camp after already being soaked to the bone.
The patrol decides to take shelter. One Paw sees a large tree and makes a run for it, not hearing Patrol Lead's scream of warning. Her mistake dawns on her the moment she takes shelter underneath what she now realizes is the tree that bleeds poison when it rains. She is too late to escape the poisoned rain now pouring down on her body, letting out a scream, spasming, then falling still. The patrol returns to c_n both eyes and fur wet.
Random decided to have some fun by splashing into large puddles. He only realizes when his skin starts to burn that he's wandered too close to the death tree. The patrol goes back to c_n in a hurry to give Random immediate medical attention.

The two siblings head out together, declaring a friendly competition to stock the fresh-kill pile. Leaf-fall makes the rockpools seem far less inviting than in the blistering heat of greenleaf, but the stories all say that the prey doesn't care about the temperature; it's supposed to be one of the benefits of being coastal cats.
-
Success
One Paw misses a b_tp_a_s, and Two Paw startles a pair of b_tp_a_p. They don't let it get them down, instead capturing a plump rabbit with a beautiful team ambush! But when they bring it back to camp, One Paw tries to take sole credit for the prey, and instead of familial talent, it's familial discord that's displayed as the apprentices get into a massive argument in the middle of camp.
Stat Cat catches a great b_mp_a_s, and two b_tp_dl_p! But his sibling comes up empty-pawed. Stat Cat offers to let him claim the smaller prey as his own, but the insulting suggestion just causes a massive argument.
-
Fail
The littermates end up dirty, exhausted, and without much more than a b_tp_a_s to show for it. Fox-dung! But at least out here, even if they didn't get much prey, they can complain about how stupidly hard hunting is to a sympathetic audience.
One Paw takes a hard fall while swiping at a b_mp_a_s in a sharply decorated rockpool, and the afternoon's hunt is called off as her sibling helps her back to camp, chatting reassuringly about how hard their hunting lessons are.

It's nice to get the chance to go out hunting with Two Paw. One Paw knows they're still in the apprentice den together, but with different mentors and focuses and skills - it's not the same as it was back in the nursery as littermates. And outrunning the leaf-fall fueled dark waves that chase up and down the beach is endlessly entertaining!
-
Success
Yeah, it's a relatively okay hunt, with a couple b_tp_a_p and a dirty b_tp_dl_s. But what One Paw is actually going to remember about today is that Two Paw thinks that his mentor and One Paw's would make a cute couple!
It turns out Stat Cat has really been listening to his mentor's tips for hunting - and he's willing to pass it on!
-
Fail
Together they manage a grand haul of one b_tp_dl_s, and not even a very big b_tp_dl_s at that. They have a lot more to learn before they'll all be ready to take on the responsibility of providing for c_n.

Success
One Paw thinks Two Paw's b_tp_dl_s looks infinitely more delicious than her own contributions of two b_tp_a_p, while Two Paw insists that he'd much rather bring back b_tp_a_p.

A b_mp_a_s and two b_mp_a_p is nothing to sniff at, as a hunting success, but stars above, being alone with Random makes Patrol Lead feel like a kitten again. And not in the cute way either - in the chewing on tails, whiny, petty, immature way. Ugh.
The hunting patrol is perfectly successful and it matters not a whit to either of the warriors, because Patrol Lead makes a joke that she thinks is funny but that's always gotten on Random's nerves, and suddenly they're both acting like apprentices again - snippy, immature, and irritable.

Random jokes that he can't possibly be related to Stat Cat - clearly Stat Cat was born from reef sharks, not cats, with the way he glides through the water.

Sometimes, the prey just doesn't run, and today is one of those times.
Random sees a fish he'd like for the fresh-kill pile, but while perched on a rock setting up a good pounce, a rogue wave washes them into the ocean. He bobs to the surface and splutter his way to shore, but his breath comes short and wheezing after the dunking. Fleas and ticks!

The hunting patrol heads out early, before the rains can make good on their dark-clouded threat.
-
Success
Patrol Lead grabs a massive b_mp_a_s that she can barely carry, and Random congratulates her, secretly wondering if he'll ever manage to surpass his sibling's achievements.
Random always feels like he's padding in Patrol Lead's footsteps, especially today, watching her hauls back such a good catch of prey for the Clan - a contribution that more than makes up for Random's meagre offerings.

bch_hunt_random_leaffall_siblings3to6warriorslocked5

The siblings head out to one of the further hunting grounds down in the dunes of a far-off forgotten corner of coast, where briefly in leaf-fall the sands are neither scorching nor frosty.
-
Success
Together, they collect an old b_mp_dl_s and four b_tp_dl_p. It should be a great patrol, returning with decent prey - but Random is acting obnoxious and his siblings have little time or patience for it.
Random makes a dumb comment that accidentally cuts deep. His siblings work with him long enough to bring back a good haul of prey - but no longer.
-
Fail
Today is just not their day.
The patrol tries to hunt, but Random keeps stopping to duck behind the dunes, until it's obvious that something is actually wrong. Eww.

bch_hunt_herb_warriorleaffall1

Patrol Lead finds a patch of herbs that she believe c_n might need for their stores. She freely admit to her patrol she isn't a medicine cat and ask her companions' advice. What do they know about the herbs available inland from the coast here, especially in the harvest season of leaf-fall?
-
Success
It's not their normal task, but they're all smart enough to value supporting the Clan's medicine den. The patrol brings the herbs back to camp, and they are put to good use.
Stat Cat carefully plucks some of the herbs and takes them back to the camp to be identified before the patrol goes to the trouble of collecting them, smartly deciding to get an informed opinion before committing the patrol.
-
Fail
The patrol brings the herbs back to camp, only to find out that while the herbs promote good gut health, they're not a rare resource. Still, c_n will be eating an extra healthy dinner tonight with the herbs sprinkled into their freshkill.

bch_hunt_newleaf_solosquirrel1

Patrol Lead stalks low to the ground, paws soft and light so as not to make a sound. Her jaws hang open to taste at the air, and a tingle of satisfaction shoots through her as she scents a nearby ground squirrel, snuffling in the sand for fresh newleaf morsels.
-
Success
The wind shifts, but before the squirrel can react Patrol Lead acts fast and leaps, stopping it from shrieking an alarm call with a quick nip to the back of the neck.
The squirrel doesn't notice Patrol Lead stalking up to them... that is, until she's already pounced and has it between her jaws. It's a little late to do anything about it at that point, though.
The squirrel blissfully snuffles around in the sand, completely unaware of the looming danger it's in. Stat Cat stalks, as quiet as a shadow, and doesn't even need to pounce; he just walks right up behind it and makes the kill.
-
Fail
The wind shifts, and the squirrel stiffens, shrieks out an alarm call, and vanishes back into its burrow. Oh well.

bch_hunt_newleaf_soloappsquirrel1

One Paw has snuck out of camp alone, hoping to be able to bring back one of the first squirrels of newleaf. Running through everything she's been taught in her head, she carefully scents the air and strains her ears, hoping for any hint of the burrowing critters in the stony outcrop they like to nest in.
-
Success
The wind blows a scent towards them, and One Paw immediately drops into a crouch. It's hard to locate in the maze of stones, and she's pretty sure at one point it's long gone, but in the end she finds and catches it!
One Paw hears a quiet snuffling nearby and slides into a hunting crouch. Slinking forward, she finds the source is a squirrel, foraging for newleaf food! She stalks carefully and catches it while it's distracted, heading home with her head held high.

Patrol Lead and One Paw sit on the beach, near a network of ground squirrel burrows hidden in the stones. This is one of a few such networks, rotated around by mentors to teach apprentices their hunting skills. One Paw scents the air as instructed and points out a burrow; sure enough, there's a squirrel's head poking out the entrance!
-
Success
Patrol Lead praises her and smiles, and One Paw drops into a hunting crouch as the squirrel crawls out of the burrow. Though her paws are rather unpracticed, the basic knowledge is solid, and her hunt is a success!

bch_hunt_newleaf_squirrel_rattlesnakerumble1

As the patrol walks through the sandy beaches of their territory, a low sound kicks up just at the edges of their hearing. Patrol Lead comes to an abrupt stop and scrambles backwards, hissing at the others to stop as well, once she realizes what's making it - there's a rattlesnake, staring down a ground squirrel!
-
Success
Watching from a careful distance, the patrol observes the squirrel chittering at it, kicking up sand and wildly whipping its tail in the air. The snake backs up and hisses before turning and slithering away. Random wastes no time in pouncing on the squirrel now that it's safe to approach, securing the meal for the Clan!
Watching from a careful distance, the patrol observes the squirrel chittering at it, kicking up sand and wildly whipping its tail in the air. The snake backs up and hisses, and the squirrel lunges!

bch_hunt_newleaf_groupsquirrel1

Patrol Lead's patrol strolls leisurely along the coastline, enjoying the smells of newleaf. One cat raises their tail, signaling for the others to be still; they've scented ground squirrels nearby.
-
Success
The patrol makes short work of locating the squirrels, spreading out into a loose formation to encircle their prey. Slowly, they move in, the circle getting tighter and tighter, until they're finally seen. The squirrels screech and scatter in different directions, but the circle cuts off their escape, and by the end of it they're fresh-kill.
First order of business is blocking their access to any nearby burrows, which Random takes care of. After that, it's a matter of finding and catching the squirrels, which proves to be simple, especially with their access to safety denied. One really couldn't ask for a better hunt.
Stat Cat murmurs instructions to his Clanmates, who nod silently and move into position. One cat feints at a squirrel, who raises the alarm and turns to run; another cat blocks off the nearby burrow's entrance, forcing the squirrels to run towards Stat Cat; and Stat Cat lunges in for the kill. A flawless hunt, not a single squirrel left behind.
-
Fail
It only takes one squirrel spotting Random to raise the alarm before they've all vanished into their burrows. Though the others made a few catches before they scattered, they didn't get nearly what they would have otherwise.

bch_hunt_redvixen1

The patrol catches the scent of a fox - but is it red or gray?
-
Success
The red vixen smells of milk, and hopefully by driving her out of the territory, her litter this newleaf won't be a threat to the Clan. If they don't starve, c_n will hunt them down - they do not share territory with foxes.
The patrol drives away the red fox, seeks out her den, and kills her young cubs. It's brutal, but these fluffy baby foxes would one day have grown to be kit-killers and thieves.
Stat Cat displays incredible skill, driving the mother vixen out of the territory almost by himself. Now neither the red fox nor her cubs pose a threat to the Clan. It truly proves Stat Cat's place as one of c_n's most talented and skillful fighters.
The patrol overcomes the red vixen and drives her off thanks to a brilliant battle move by Stat Cat at a critical moment. His bravery ensures the patrol's success, and the cats arrive back at camp singing his praises to make sure the Clan knows it.

Led by Patrol Lead and with a heap of cooperation and teamwork, the patrol drives away the red fox, seeks out her den, and kills her young cubs. The coasts will be safe from both the threat the vixen posed this season, and the threat her cubs would've given c_n in the seasons to come.
With so many cats working together in tight coordination, they manage to accomplish the near-impossible, killing the red mother vixen and ending the threat to the Clan that she and her cubs pose.

Stat Cat displays incredible skill, driving the mother vixen and her brood off of the coast all by himself. Now neither the red fox nor her dependent cubs pose a threat to the Clan. He swells with pride, feeling the confidence of knowing that he's truly one of the best fighters c_n has ever produced.
A brilliant battle move by Stat Cat knocks the red vixen off balance, and Stat Cat manages to drive her out of c_n territory, though it takes every spark of strength in his pelt to do it alone.

Success
The stocky gray vixen they track down smells of milk, and though she's nearly double the weight of any of the patrol and all of it muscle, they meet her eyes squarely and leap to attack. c_n does not tolerate sharing their territory with foxes, and they work together to drive her off.
The patrol drives away the gray fox, seeks out her den, and kills her young cubs. It's brutal, but these fluffy baby foxes would one day have grown to be kit-killers and thieves. Better to deal with them now than when they're the height and nearly double the weight of a cat, though a gray fox will always be easier than a big red one.
Stat Cat displays incredible skill, driving the mother vixen out of the territory almost by himself. Now neither the gray fox nor her cubs pose a threat to the Clan. It places Stat Cat as one of c_n's most talented and skillful fighters; a gray fox is a dangerous competitor.

-
Success
One Paw misses a b_tp_a_s, and Two Paw startles a pair of b_tp_a_p. They don't let it get them down, instead capturing a plump rabbit with a beautiful team ambush! But when they bring it back to camp, One Paw tries to take sole credit for the prey, and instead of familial talent, it's familial discord that's displayed as the apprentices get into a massive argument in the middle of camp.
Stat Cat catches a great b_mp_a_s and two b_tp_dl_p! But his sibling comes up empty-pawed. Stat Cat offers to let him claim the smaller prey as his own, but the insulting suggestion just causes a massive argument.

The littermates end up dirty, exhausted, and without much more than a b_tp_dl_s to show for it. Fox-dung! But at least out here, even if they didn't get much prey, they can complain about how stupidly hard hunting is to a sympathetic audience.
One Paw takes a hard fall while swiping at a b_mp_a_s in a sharply decorated rockpool, and the afternoon's hunt is called off as her sibling helps her back to camp, chatting reassuringly about how hard their hunting lessons are.

It's nice to get the chance to go out hunting with Two Paw. One Paw knows they're still in the apprentice den, but with different mentors and focuses and skills - it's not the same as it was back in the nursery as littermates. And with newleaf bringing nicer weather it's a good time to hunt!
-
Success
Yeah, it's a relatively okay hunt, with a couple b_tp_a_p and a dirty b_tp_dl_s. But what One Paw is actually going to remember about today is that Two Paw thinks that his mentor and One Paw's would make a cute couple!
It turns out Stat Cat has really been listening to his mentor's tips for hunting - and he's willing to pass it on!
-

-
Success
One Paw thinks Two Paw's b_tp_dl_s looks infinitely more delicious than her own contributions of two b_tp_a_p, while Three Paw insists that she'd much rather bring back b_tp_a_p than the b_mp_a_s she caught.
Stat Cat spends half the patrol in the heavy waves of the tidal zone, both impressing and frustrating the siblings trying to keep up with him.
-
Fail
Well, they have a lot of fun exploring, even if it's not that productive of a hunting patrol.

bch_hunt_random_newleaf_siblings6applocked1

The six siblings head out together, declaring a friendly competition to stock the fresh-kill pile. Newleaf has brought storms to the territory, but today is clear and sunny, and there's got to be a sea monster or two, washed up waiting to be hunted in the rockpools!
-
Success
One Paw misses a b_tp_a_s, and her siblings startle a pair of b_tp_a_p. They don't let it get them down, instead capturing a plump rabbit with a beautiful team ambush! But when they bring it back to camp, One Paw tries to take sole credit for the prey, and instead of familial talent, it's familial discord that's displayed as the apprentices get into a massive argument in the middle of camp.
Stat Cat catches a great b_mp_a_s and two b_tp_dl_p! But his siblings come up empty-pawed. Stat Cat offers to let them claim the smaller prey as their own, but the insulting suggestion just causes a massive argument.
-
Fail
The littermates end up dirty, exhausted, and without much more than a b_tp_dl_s to show for it. Fox-dung! But at least out here, even if they didn't get much prey, they can complain about how stupidly hard hunting is to a sympathetic audience.
One Paw takes a hard fall while swiping at a b_mp_a_s in a sharply decorated rockpool, and the afternoon's hunt is called off as her siblings help her back to camp, chatting reassuringly about how hard their hunting lessons are.
-

bch_hunt_random_newleaf_siblings6applocked2

It's nice to get the chance to go out hunting together. One Paw knows they're all still in the apprentice den, but with different mentors and focuses and skills - it's not the same as it was back in the nursery with her littermates. And with newleaf bringing nicer weather it's a good time to hunt!
-
Success
Yeah, it's a relatively okay hunt, with a couple b_tp_a_p and a dirty b_tp_dl_s. But what One Paw is actually going to remember about today is that Two Paw thinks that his mentor and Three Paw's would make a cute couple!
It turns out Stat Cat has really been listening to his mentor's tips for hunting - and he's willing to pass it on!
-
Fail
Together they manage a grand haul of one b_tp_dl_s, and not even a very big b_tp_dl_s at that. They have a lot more to learn before they'll all be ready to take on the responsibility of providing for c_n.

One Paw suppresses a yawn, trying not to make a weird expression in front of Patrol Lead as she do. Patrol Lead suggested this as sibling bonding time, but did they <i>really</i> have to get up at dawn? There's dew absolutely <i>everywhere</i>, including now in every crevice of One Paw.
-
Success
One Paw collects two b_tp_dl_p, and watches Patrol Lead take down a b_mp_a_s in an astonishing pounce. She's about to trot up to Patrol Lead to express admiration over the kill when Patrol Lead turns around and compliments One Paw's b_tp_dl_p, making One Paw grimace at what's got to be fake praise.
Watching Stat Cat's displays of athleticism makes One Paw feel small - surely she'll never be able to do that?

As they wander along a cliff path, picking their way through the flowers trying to choke off the trail, Patrol Lead awkwardly asks One Paw how she think her training is going.
-
Success
Giving in and accepting that she's just going to look stupid in front of her cool older sibling, One Paw tells Patrol Lead about the trouble she's been having with her pounce. It's such a simple thing - she should have it by now! But Patrol Lead is actually super helpful and reassuring about it, it's nice.
Because, you see, if One Paw ever wanted help - Stat Cat knows they're not littermates, but they're still siblings, Stat Cat is totally here for her if One Paw ever wants extra training. It's still an awkward offer. But it's nice.

One Paw doesn't want to talk about it. Like. At all. She stalk off in a huff.

One Paw knows her patrol is still bringing back a little prey for the fresh-kill pile, but... it's so disappointing. She really wanted to prove how much she's grown to Patrol Lead.

bch_hunt_random_newleaf_siblings2warriorslocked1

Patrol Lead has just rediscovered one of her least favorite parts of newleaf, as the gulls clamor in endless loud arguments with each other overhead while Patrol Lead pads on her hunting patrol with Random.
-
Success
A b_mp_a_s and two b_tp_dl_p is nothing to sniff at, as a hunting success, but stars above, being alone with Random makes Patrol Lead feel like a kitten again. And not in the cute way either - in the chewing on tails, whiny, petty, immature way. Ugh.
The hunting patrol is perfectly successful and it matters not a whit to either of the warriors, because Patrol Lead makes a joke that she thinks is funny but that's always gotten on Random's nerves, and suddenly they're both acting like apprentices again - snippy, immature, and irritable.
Stat Cat nets them two healthy b_mp_a_p to take back to camp, but it only irritates his sibling. Random never even got the chance to even try for a pounce. Is he only there to carry around Stat Cat's prey?
-
Fail
It isn't a very successful hunt - they'll have to head out again for more soon.

Sometimes, it's just nice to hang out with his sibling. Especially when the sun's out, warming their backs and making fishing a comfortable sport.
-
Success
A scruffy b_mp_a_s, a bundle of b_tp_a_p, and a patrol spent retreading all their favorite in-jokes - it's a good day.
There's just something nice about hanging out with another warrior who'll always be there for him, regardless of their similarities and differences. And they also bring back a good-sized b_mp_a_s with some b_tp_a_p on the side for the fresh-kill pile.
Random is proud of Stat Cat, watching him dart among the waves, foam bubbling around his pelt.

Fail
They don't manage anything like the number of catches they were both expecting to get - a bit disappointing, even if they're not entirely empty-pawed.

The wind bouncing off the waves promises a fine day, clear bright and fresh, and Random has been assigned a moderately tolerable hunting partner - his sibling!
-
Success
Watching Random execute a fantastic leap to bring down a b_mp_dl_s, Patrol Lead smiles. Does Random remember the time he tried to do that as a kitten and stood on his own tail? The siblings laugh about it as they move on to the next hunting ground.
It's been a while since they've been on a patrol alone together, and after they catch a b_mp_dl_s for the fresh-kill pile, Random spends a bit just chasing Patrol Lead along the coastline, batting at each other in a moment of silliness.
Random jokes that he can't possibly be related to Stat Cat - clearly Stat Cat was born from reef sharks, not cats, with the way he glides through the water.
-
Fail
Sometimes, the prey just doesn't run, and today is one of those times.
Random sees a fish he'd like for the fresh-kill pile, but while perched on a rock setting up a good pounce a rogue wave washes them into the ocean. He bobs to the surface and splutter his way to shore, but his breath comes short and wheezing after the dunking. Fleas and ticks!

Success
Patrol Lead grabs a massive b_mp_a_s that she can barely carry, and Random congratulates her, secretly wondering if he'll ever manage to surpass his sibling's achievements.
Random always feels like he's padding in Patrol Lead's footsteps, especially today, watching her hauls back such a good catch of prey for the Clan - a contribution that more than makes up for Random's meagre offerings.

The siblings head out to one of the furthest hunting grounds of their salty home, where scrubby bush dips down to a bay sheltered both landwards and seawards.

Success
Together, they collect an old b_mp_a_s and two b_mp_dl_p. It should be a great patrol, returning with decent prey - but Random is acting obnoxious and his sibling has little time or patience for it.
Random makes a dumb comment that accidentally cuts deep. His sibling works with him long enough to bring back a good haul of prey - but no longer.

Today is just not their day.
The patrol tries to hunt, but Random keeps stopping to duck behind bushes, until it's obvious that something is actually wrong. Eww.

bch_hunt_herb_warriornewleaf1

Patrol Lead finds a patch of herbs that she believe c_n might need for their stores. She freely admit to her patrol she isn't a medicine cat and ask her companions' advice. What do they know about the herbs available inland from the coast here, especially with the herb stores still recovering from leaf-bare?
-
Success
It's not their normal task, but they're all smart enough to value supporting the Clan's medicine den. The patrol brings the herbs back to camp and they are put to good use.
Stat Cat carefully plucks some of the herbs and takes them back to the camp to be identified before the patrol goes to the trouble of collecting them, smartly deciding to get an informed opinion before committing the patrol.
-
Fail
The patrol brings the herbs back to camp, only to find out that while the herbs promote good gut health, they're not a rare resource. Still, c_n will be eating an extra healthy dinner tonight with the herbs sprinkled into their fresh-kill.

bch_med_soloripples1

While gathering fresh water, Patrol Lead sees strange ripples on the surface of a puddle.
-
Success
As Patrol Lead looks into the puddle, she's greeted by an intense vision. She drops what she's doing and races back to the camp to consult with the leader - water can wait, this is far more important.
Patrol Lead is greeted with the vision of a cat she had failed to save, content and happy in StarClan. The cat gives them a gentle smile, softly telling Patrol Lead that she was never at fault for their death. Patrol Lead's shoulders sag with the weight of her relief, and Patrol Lead feels the burden of the death lift from over her head.
-
Fail
She gazes eagerly into the puddle, only to see the weird ripples were caused by a small frog. Patrol Lead sighs in disappointment - she really could have used some guidance from StarClan.

bch_med_clair1

While on a trip to gather herbs, Patrol Lead slows to a stop. The random patch of beach she lingers on doesn't look important, but she's suddenly overcome by an otherworldly feeling of clair_list_emotional. What could this mean?
-
Success
She stops and considers the feeling for a moment, allowing herself to linger. This might be important for the future, or it could simply be the left-over feelings of an event long past... Either way, Patrol Lead doesn't stay too long before returning to herb collecting.
These feelings could prove important; they have in the past, at least. Patrol Lead makes herself comfortable on the beach, letting the feelings wash over her and carry her away. Eventually she returns to herb collecting, content in the new knowledge and understanding she's gained.
-
Fail
This is nothing short of disconcerting. Patrol Lead does her best to shake off the feeling and hurry away from the area. Even so, she finds her mind occupied with the memory and can't manage to concentrate on herb gathering.
-

bch_med_herblocation1

Patrol Lead looks at the calm, cloudless sky and decides it's a good opportunity to show One Paw where some of the most commonly needed herbs are located in her territory, as well as where and when to burrow into the sand to find the more potent roots she tends to use.
-
Success
One Paw is focused and attentive, giving Patrol Lead confidence that next time there is an emergency, One Paw will be able to find the herbs they need both in and out of the sand.
As Patrol Lead is explaining why and where the herbs are growing, One Paw lets out a shout and bolts ahead. To Patrol Lead's surprise, she has found a previously unknown patch of an uncommon herb! Stunned, but filled with pride that she found and recognized the herb, Patrol Lead promises them the first pick of fresh-kill as soon as they return to camp.
-
Fail
One Paw is constantly distracted, running ahead at every little noise or interesting sight, much to the frustration of Patrol Lead. Evidently, no new knowledge will be gained that day.

One Paw has been sent out onto the beaches to try to find some specific herbs alone.

Success
One Paw is focused, determined to prove her independence. She finds the herbs easily and bring them back to camp with her head held up high - no sweat, no stress, no fuss.
One Paw goes to an herb patch she's sure she knows, only to find the plants withered and dead. She refuses to give up, however, tenaciously searching the area until she comes across a smaller, overlooked patch that still has some leaves hanging on.

Patrol Lead and One Paw are going out to gather dandelions. One Paw asks her mentor what they'll do if the rabbits have eaten all of it, and Patrol Lead responds that they'll cross that river when they get to it.
-
Success
The two medicine cats find the plants in good shape and are able to collect plenty.
The dandelions are so plentiful that it seems there's enough for cats and rabbits alike to take what they need.

One Paw reaches the patch first, but Patrol Lead can tell by her drooping ears that there must not be enough left to collect.

bch_med_appfirstsign1

One Paw pads out of camp, ready to gather some herbs at the behest of her mentor. The wind gently rustles through the beach grass as she pads along.
-
Success
Patrol Lead is plucking some rosemary when her attention is suddenly grabbed by omen_list_sight. The fur on her back begins to prickle slightly, the sound of her heartbeat like thunder in her ears. She turns and hare back to camp, herbs forgotten. She needs to tell her mentor about this as soon as possible!
-
Fail
One Paw feels a pit of dread beginning to form in her belly - she's forgotten where to find the herb her mentor wanted. She tastes the air, hoping desperately for some hint of its tell-tale scent, but it's a useless effort. She'll have to swallow her pride and return to ask for directions.

bch_med_rainygathering1

Patrol Lead leads a patrol out to explore c_n's territory and bring back any herbs she can spot. Her whiskers want to twitch with every raindrop that hits her, but the Clan doesn't have the luxury to sit inside away from the weather.
-
Success
It's absolutely miserable weather to gather herbs in, and Patrol Lead wishes he didn't have to. Despite Random nearly slipping and falling over on more than one occasion and the rest of the patrol getting absolutely soaked to the bone, he does - somehow - still manage to bring back some herbs.
The keen-eyed Stat Cat spots herbs quickly, and the cats harvest them and retreat back to the camp, where it's nice and dry. No point in lingering for a second more than he needs to with the weather like this!
-
Fail
Patrol Lead <i>knows</i> the conditions are miserable, but this group is somehow more insufferable! Not only does she has to put up with these cats for an entire afternoon, there's also nothing to show for it at the end of the day.

bch_med_gatheringcobwebs1

Patrol Lead heads out into the territory to stock up on cobwebs, something the Clan never seems to have enough of.
-
Success
Patrol Lead finds plenty of cobwebs, gently collecting them on the ends of sticks. No cat will have the chance to bleed out - not now, with so many cobwebs to staunch their wounds!
Patrol Lead visits a few of her favorite places to gather cobwebs. When she gets back to camp, she ends up startling several cats on her way back to her den - Patrol Lead is practically a walking cobweb, impossible to see beneath the sheer mass she has gathered.
-
Fail
Overtired from caring for her patients all day and night, the only cobwebs Patrol Lead manages to 'collect' are the ones she accidentally walked into.

Patrol Lead heads out into the territory with One Paw, both to stock up on cobwebs and to teach the apprentice how to gather one of the Clan's most vital medical tools.

Patrol Lead finds plenty of cobwebs, gently collecting them on the ends of sticks. One Paw works hard alongside herself to gather as many as they can, her eyes glittering with joy and pride as she works.
Patrol Lead takes One Paw to a few of her favorite places to gather cobwebs. When they get back to camp, they end up startling several cats on their way back to their den - Patrol Lead and One Paw are practically walking cobwebs, impossible to see beneath the sheer mass they have gathered.

Fail
One Paw doesn't seem to be able to focus today, and Patrol Lead isn't much better off, tired from teaching her apprentice and caring for her patients. After One Paw accidentally ruins a cobweb while playing with it, Patrol Lead decides to call the whole thing off and try again another day.
-
-----
bch_med_cobwebhelp1

c_n can never have enough cobwebs, Patrol Lead instructs her team, leading them out to search for them.
-
Success
Patrol Lead mrrps with laughter, watching Random parade around with such a big bundle of cobwebs that he keeps colliding with things in his path he can't see. The entire patrol has gotten a wonderful haul, and it's a very pleased medicine cat that leads them back to camp.
The patrol brings back a truly massive haul and return in good humor, laughing as she set down her sticks of spun-up webbing in the medicine cat den. Patrol Lead joins everyone as they sit down to share tongues, ridding their pelts of dust and the odd spider as the cats catch up with each other and enjoy the day.
Stat Cat's keen eyes have a knack for spotting the gossamer-thin strands of cobwebs, and with the patrol there to follow his lead, it's a very successful gathering mission.

Can warriors not pay attention, even to something as simple as cobwebs?! Patrol Lead holds her breath and counts to ten before she dismisses the patrol, every found cobweb ruined - what little she did manage to find.

Patrol Lead heads out on an herb-gathering patrol, searching for the ever-green, ever-reliable horsetail to harvest for the herb stores.

Snapping off the thick horsetail stem near the base of the plant allows Patrol Lead to drag an entire big, long shoot back to camp, where she diligently processes it down further into smaller stem sections that are easily stored.
Stat Cat deftly picks out an entire horsetail shoot, bringing back quite the impressive addition to the Clan's herb stores.

bch_med_horsetaillesson1

Patrol Lead heads out on an herb-gathering patrol, searching for the ever-green, ever-reliable horsetail to harvest for the herb stores. One Paw trots after her, asking her why horsetail grows so weirdly without leaves.
-
Success
Patrol Lead doesn't know why horsetail plants lack leaves, but she encourages One Paw's interest in the topic. As a plant that grows without losing any of its green in leaf-bare, while <i>also</i> having a crucial herbal use in stopping blood-loss, horsetail is a welcome sight in any well-stocked medicine cat den.
Snapping off the thick horsetail stem near the base of the plant allows Patrol Lead to drag an entire big, long shoot back to camp, where One Paw processes it down further into small stem sections that are easily stored, making a neat pile in the medicine cat den with Patrol Lead.

bch_med_gatheringmoss1

Patrol Lead notices that the moss in the medicine den is getting old. She needs to go and gather some more.
-
Success
Patrol Lead quickly makes her way to the best moss patch she knows. She spends a bit of time slicing bits off with her claws, careful not to get any roots or dirt in the pile - once she's satisfied, she takes a moment to wrap her jaws around the heap, then make her way back to camp.

Patrol Lead notices that the moss in the medicine den is getting old. She needs to go and gather some more.

Success
Patrol Lead leads the way to the best moss patch she knows, with her entourage following close behind. The cats begin cutting off bits of moss and making their respective piles. Once the piles turn into mouthfuls, they pick up the bundles of new bedding and start back towards camp.

bch_med_gatheringrosemary1

Patrol Lead has to attend to one of her grimmer jobs as a medicine cat - the grounds where c_n goes to mourn their dead need to be tended to. She's bringing along One Paw as her assistant for this trip, and the two cats head out in relative silence.
-
Success
Even though there's nothing different about this place, other than the serenity it was chosen for, Patrol Lead always feels that the grief and love her Clanmates express here has seeped into every corner. She tidies the grounds, collecting rosemary as she works. It feels appropriate for the plant to grow here, when its herbs are used to hide the scent of death.
-
Fail
There's a sharp yowl of pain, followed by a string of muttered curses, and Patrol Lead turns to see One Paw holding one of her paws off the ground. It seems that the apprentice stepped on a thorn. Ouch! She'll have to go back to camp and fix that up.

bch_med_discussion1

Patrol Lead and Random head inland to look for herbs, discussing the latest news.
-
Success
They have a good discussion while foraging among the dunes and manage to come up with several ideas to discuss with c_n's leadership.
Carefully plucking some herbs, they discuss the latest signs from StarClan and ponder what to do about them. They manage to think up some tentative plans and return to camp to discuss them with the leader and deputy.
-
Fail
They fail to interpret any signs and are too irritated with each other to discuss any other news. Furthermore, neither cat manages to gather anything when the trip is cut short by the ominous looking clouds springing up over the ocean.

Patrol Lead and Random take a look at their supply of herbs and decide to combine their efforts into searching for more. Two sets of trained eyes are better than one!
-
Success
Patrol Lead and Random decide to search near the Twoleg beach dens. As the sun sinks towards the horizon, they return with their mouths stuffed full of herbs taken from the weirdly bountiful Twoleg territories.
Patrol Lead and Random decide on a little friendly competition - one medicine cat to another, like all those silly bets the warriors make about hunting prey. They reunite when the sun is going down and walk into camp purring and playfully shoving each other with both their mouths full of herbs.
-
Fail
Both Patrol Lead and Random are tense and it shows. Even though it should not be this hard to find any herbs, they fail to find even a single one. They return to camp frustrated and irritated with each other.
Even though there should be many herbs, they fail to find anything. Patrol Lead blames Random for distracting her, and they get into a huge argument.

The apprentices head out into the territory, following Patrol Lead a little dubiously. Gathering things can't possibly be as hard as hunting them - plants don't run away!
-
Success
It's a long, weird, hard day. <i>Yes,</i> the cobwebs. <i>Yes,</i> they bring them back to camp - but by StarClan, none of the warrior apprentices were expecting something as simple as cobweb gathering to be so hard, not when it feels like they run into one every other hunt! They definitely end up with a new appreciation for Patrol Lead's skills.
... However, once out of camp, the apprentices realize they're out of their depth, and turn to Patrol Lead for help. Patrol Lead, to her credit, is very gracious about it, not making anyone feel stupid, and by the time the patrol returns with a successful haul, there's a new feeling of rapport between everyone, regardless of their role.

Patrol Lead is disgusted with the general disdain she feels from the other apprentices and how hypocritical it is to tell them herb gathering is easy when the patrol hasn't found <i>any</i> cobwebs! She stalks back to the medicine cat den in a huff, unable to bear being near the other apprentices for any longer than she has been.

There's nothing to apologize for! Random bumps Patrol Lead's shoulder affectionately, brushing past herself with a smile as she leaves camp. It's a fine way to spend the afternoon and a cool cat to spend it with!
Random seems somewhat irritated at first, but as Patrol Lead keeps chatting to herself, she starts to warm up, and both apprentices feel much more comfortable with each other by the time they bring their mossy loot back to camp.

Random shrugs, tailtip twitching with irritation. It's fine, it's totally not like he'd prefer to be hunting, doing something actually useful...

Patrol Lead goes out to take advantage of the greenleaf growing season with a warrior escort, both for safety and for carrying capacity should she find anything.

Success
Surprisingly, Random actually starts up a conversation with her about the herbs they're looking for. Patrol Lead launches into the usual spiel, but even more astonishingly, Random is actually interested, and it makes her heart feel lighter getting to share her knowledge and skills with someone who respects her.
Stat Cat has always been good at talking, so it isn't a big surprise that Patrol Lead finds it so easy to chat with him. It's just an herb gathering patrol, but Patrol Lead feels more relaxed than she's felt in moons when she comes back to camp, smiling softly.
-
Fail
It's an exhausting day. Patrol Lead starts chatting with Random to pass the time, but they have nothing in common, and the other cat bluntly refuses to talk about boring herbs.

The ground is dusty and slippery, and as Patrol Lead falls, Random catches her. It's a nice reminder that the responsibility of looking after the Clan is a shared one, and the rescue also makes Patrol Lead shiver pleasantly.
Random disappears for a moment, only to return with a pretty flower in his jaws. Patrol Lead chuckles and reminds him that it's not medicinal. Random smiles, setting the flower down. Perhaps not, but he thought it would make a nice gift. Patrol Lead, charmed, carries the flower with her for the rest of the patrol.

-
Success
Patrol Lead is relieved to find that the mullein is still intact. She knocks a stray weevil off of a leaf as she's gathering the herb.
Not only is the mullein intact and growing nicely, but there's also a nice patch of plantain growing just nearby. Patrol Lead purrs in satisfaction - seems like she's caught two prey in one blow on this trip. She'll remember that plantain for later.
-

Patrol Lead reaches the mullein plant that the Clan has used for many seasons, only to find out it's being torn to shreds by bugs. She hisses in exasperation, batting some of the leaf bugs off the plant. Maybe it'll grow back next newleaf.

The burdock plants are plentiful in the area that Patrol Lead chose. She'll have a good supply to last a while!
-

Patrol Lead can't find the burdock plant she was thinking of. Maybe it was elsewhere in the territory...?
By the time they reach the burdock plants, Patrol Lead is about ready to claw Stat Cat's ears off. Great StarClan! <i>How</i> can a cat be so annoying? Patrol Lead hisses in exasperation, just as she notices that the burdock is all shriveled and dead - the roots won't be any good. It's just one thing after another today.

Perfect - there's a good crop of blackberry leaves just waiting for her, and the bramble seems to be sending out new exploratory branches too, promising more growth in the future. As she sets out the leaves out to dry before they're put away in the herb stores, Patrol Lead lets out a purr at the sight of her harvest.
Stat Cat falls into the meditative state that herb-gathering brings, and he hums to himself as he works, crisply plucking from the blackberry brambles.

Success
The heat of greenleaf has made the burdock grow to towering size, with some leaves approaching the length of an adult cat. It's not finding them that's hard, it's trying to carry all the roots back to camp all at once that proves difficult! One Paw actually topples over at one point, although Patrol Lead pretends she didn't see, hiding her smile.

bch_med_gatheringcatmint_greenleaf1

Patrol Lead heads out into the sunshine, padding away from camp in a search for one of the most elusive herbs.
-
Success
It takes a morning full of careful searching, but eventually one of the catmint plants Patrol Lead remembers from seasons past is revisited, and to her delight, it's growing well. Patrol Lead avoids taking the flowers, giving the plant the chance to spread catmint seed for the future.
Stat Cat has a few baby catmint sprouts he's been leaving alone through newleaf, and greenleaf means it's time to see if they're harvestable. They are, and Stat Cat is able to bring huge quantities of the valuable herb home.

bch_med_gatheringcatmint_greenleaf2

Patrol Lead waits until she's out of camp to reveal to One Paw that she's off to find catmint - a 'helpful' group of 'helpers' can be a little... well, unhelpful. Catmint is just too exciting for many of her Clanmates to keep her heads around, and Patrol Lead wants to take advantage of the peak greenleaf growing season.
-
Success
As they walk, Patrol Lead teaches One Paw about how crucial catmint is for coughs and how, although its scent holds drugged pleasure, part of the responsibility of being a medicine cat is avoiding becoming caught in its haze. The medicine cats carefully pick out catmint from its known hiding places, carrying it back to camp where it will protect the Clan.

As Patrol Lead looks at the twitching tails and wide eyes of the patrol set up to 'help' her gathers catmint, her heart sinks. These overly excited warriors don't look like they're going to be useful, and catmint is too important to be silly about collecting. Yes, it smells wonderful. <i>Please</i> get over it.

It takes a morning of careful searching, but eventually one of the catmint plants Patrol Lead remembers from seasons past is revisited, and to her delight, it's growing well. Patrol Lead keeps the patrol back from the plant, not willing to let them roll around in it, but the warriors are perfectly happy to carry their wild-smelling burdens home without fuss.
Stat Cat has a few baby catmint sprouts he's been leaving alone through newleaf, and greenleaf means it's time to see if they're harvestable. They are, and Stat Cat is able to bring huge quantities of the valuable herb home, though a couple sprigs are damaged by his helpers.

Fail
Patrol Lead is proven unfortunately correct, as the patrol is full of juvenile behavior and dumb jokes, rather than focused effort. The one catmint plant she successfully find ends up with her helpers rolling around in it, bruising all the stems until it's unharvestable, and Patrol Lead is furious by the time she returns to camp.

Greenleaf brings a veritable explosion of daisies raising little white and yellow flowers around every corner, and Patrol Lead barely even needs to leave camp to gather them.

Truly, dandelions are an essential herb to keep in stock, crucial for poisons and stings. Both the potent milk in their roots and stems, and the fast-acting leaves... even the fluffy dandelion heads are useful as a c_n kitten's favorite, short lived toy.

Elder leaves being used to <i>soothe</i> sprains and elder leaves having to be gathered in a way that <i>risks</i> sprains is truly one of StarClan's little ironies, Patrol Lead reflects. One Paw is more occupied climbing the tree, and Patrol Lead isn't going to dissuade her pride in plucking from the highest branches, even if they're no more potent than those at the bottom.
The tree, growing in a sheltered spot without huge amounts of wind, has branches that extend a mere whisker-length above the ground. The gathering is simple, today, warmed by the greenleaf sun.

It's at least a little funny, how elder leaves are so suited for easing the pains of the Clan's elders. The tree isn't named for that - there's an old myth about a medicine cat asking an ancient tree for advice - but sometimes the coincidence amuses Patrol Lead.

As they lift their muzzles to try and catch mallow's sweet scent on the wind, Patrol Lead asks the patrol if they know how the herb got its name.

Try as they might, no one can sniff out any mallow, and the cats return to camp empty-pawed.
They find mallow... but Random ends up eating it instead of carrying it back, resulting in the herbs being ruined.

Success
Once upon a time there was a plant that, unusually, loved not the midday sun's strength, but the sunset's quiet beauty.

Listen to the wisdom of the sages, Patrol Lead meows. One Paw doesn't just need to learn to set bones and clean wounds, being a medicine cat is so much more than blood and bodies.
-
Success
Some sicknesses aren't physical, but live in the mind instead, Patrol Lead instructs. That's very normal, and just as a Clanmate with a twisted leg is just as loved and valued as one who can run without pain, an illness that is mental is just as valid of a struggle, the cats just as loved and supported in their needs.

One Paw feels overwhelmed with the responsibility of supporting Clanmates going through mental struggles - physical fights are so much simpler to support them with. Patrol Lead halts the lesson to comfort her.

This garlic will certainly restock the herb stores... which are close to Patrol Lead's nest. Yay...
The leaves, and especially the bulbs, of wild garlic are the preeminent herb to treat infection, even if using them results each time in either Patrol Lead's patient or their loved ones complaining about the smell. Patrol Lead, personally, will take a bit of a bad smell over illness, thank you very much.
Stat Cat, ever eagle-eyed, spots grass that looks suspiciously tall with oddly thick blades. One sniff confirms it as wild garlic, and this patch has heaps to harvest.

The patrol joins her, tense and focused, and it's a weary group that returns back to camp as the sun dips toward the horizon, exhausted - but successful.
Sometimes, Patrol Lead finds her near giddy with gratitude for evergreens, plants that scoff at leaf-bare and grow in spite of it. It's not an effect of the plant - juniper calms, not induces euphoria - just the relief of still having a fresh herb source in leaf-bare, and the warmth of having her Clanmates there to help she gather it.
Sometimes, it's not finding plants to harvest that is the problem, it's finding plants to <i>safely</i> harvest. Stat Cat finds a juniper tree on a slope with easily accessible lower branches to harvest from without any cat needing to risk him climbing in leaf-bare.

Fail
Patrol Lead finds a couple of juniper trees with their evergreen leaves shocking against the scarcity of leaf-bare, but none have any branches that are low enough to harvest from safely.
Random, edging out onto a skinny branch to try to get some juniper leaves, slips on the frosted wood and plummets off the tree, hitting the ground hard.

Patrol Lead returns to camp with stone-cold paws and a new hatred for digging, but carrying bulbs of garlic.
Something you really don't want in leaf-bare is an infection, and that's exactly what garlic's stinky specialty is. After a long, exhausting day in the cold, Patrol Lead manages to bring back a good haul of their bulbs for the herb stores.

Patrol Lead searches and searches, but eventually she has to admit defeat. She can't remember where the garlic grew when the world was warm.
When Patrol Lead arrives back at camp, she's shivering and cold. Digging into the leaf-bare ground in a search for bulbs that weren't there was both unproductive and senseless. At least her den is nice and warm, chasing away the chill.
Digging into the leaf-bare ground in a search for bulbs that weren't there was both unproductive and senseless, and this mistake cost Random his life.

Surprisingly, Random actually starts up a conversation with him about the herbs he's looking for. Patrol Lead launches into the usual spiel, but even more astonishingly, Random is actually interested, and it makes his heart feel lighter getting to share his knowledge and skills with someone who respects him.
Stat Cat has always been good at talking, so it isn't a big surprise that Patrol Lead finds it so easy to chat with her. It's just an herb gathering patrol, but Patrol Lead feels more relaxed than she's felt in moons when she comes back to camp, smiling softly.

It's an exhausting day. Patrol Lead starts chatting with Random to pass the time, but he has nothing in common, and the other cat bluntly refuses to talk about boring herbs.

Careful now. Patrol Lead finds the blackberry bramble, utterly coated in berries. This is both the season for blackberry picking and the time to leave the leaves alone in anticipation of leaf-bare. The berries are a poor substitute for the leaves, but a medicine cat has to think of the future.
Perfect - there's a good crop of blackberries just waiting for her, and the bramble seems to be sending out new exploratory branches too, promising more growth in the future.

Truly, dandelions are an essential herb to keep in stock, crucial for poison and stings.

Elder leaves being used to <i>soothe</i> sprains and elder leaves having to be gathered in a way that <i>risks</i> sprains is truly one of StarClan's little ironies, Patrol Lead reflects.

She chooses leaves as close to green as possible for maximum usefulness, which she finds tends to fade the redder her leaves get. One Paw soaks up the information, filing it away in her ever-increasing herbcraft knowledge.
Stat Cat has managed to discover with time and experience that elder leaf picking is actually better handled by chewing off several low hanging, thin branches, and carrying those back to camp instead. He passes on the trick to One Paw, and once he's back at camp both medicine cats strip off the leaves and give them a quick wash.

With leaf-fall washing the world in tones of red and brown, Patrol Lead feels the need to gather as many elder leaves as possible, before the season turns and the Clan must survive without new stocks during leaf-bare. There's a particular tree in a sheltered dip along a stream she wants to check on today, bringing a group of her Clanmates with her.
-
Success
Elder leaves being used to <i>soothe</i> sprains and elder leaves having to be gathered in a way that <i>risks</i> sprains is truly one of StarClan's little ironies, Patrol Lead reflects. She shares the little joke with the patrol, and the cats murrp with amusement, but it does also remind everyone to be careful as she strips leaves from the tree.
Ignoring the leaves piled up at the tree's base, which lack potency, Patrol Lead is pickier with her gathering. She chooses leaves as close to green as possible for maximum usefulness, which she finds tends to fade the redder her leaves get. The warriors are less selective, but the sheer quantity Patrol Lead's able to bring back to camp more than makes up for it.
Stat Cat has discovered with time and experience that elder leaf picking is actually better handled by chewing off several low hanging, thin branches, and carrying those back to camp instead. With so many assistants, he can bring a truly massive haul home, where the rest of the patrol helps he strip the leaves and carefully store him.

It's at least a little funny, how elder leaves are so suited for easing the pains of the Clan's elders. The tree isn't named for that - there's an old myth about a medicine cat asking an ancient tree for advice - but sometimes the coincidence amuses Patrol Lead.

One Paw listens intently, as the hours drift slowly by in her intense search, and then finally spots a bush with leaves sprinkled with white. It's lungwort! Patrol Lead showers her with praise. One Paw feels like she could burst with pride over her accomplishment.

Patrol Lead is always amused by the plantain's enduring cheerfulness in the face of being trodden on, and it's nice that the plants grow with such enthusiasm right to the end of leaf-fall. One Paw asks if she'll really die back in leaf-bare - the plant seems too determined to give up in the cold.

Suitable for soothing throat and pelt irritation, and with a welcome - albeit weird - habit of consistently sprouting up on well-trodden paths, plantain is a basic but valuable herb to keep stocks of. It's even relatively innocuous taste-wise, making it easy to harvest.

Ugh. The ragwort Patrol Lead finds is flowering, and the yellow flowers of the plant waft out her scent, leaving a foul taste hanging in the air.
Ragwort brings strength to cats who need it and eases aching joints, but StarClan it tastes absolutely <i>foul.</i> Patrol Lead's pleased with her harvest but really wishes she had a way to bring it back to camp that didn't need she to carry it in her mouth.

While gathering herbs, Patrol Lead spots a bush of red berries.

Success
Patrol Lead identifies her as raspberries and carefully chews off a branch laden with her to bring back to camp - the herb stocks can use this odd fruit, especially its leaves.
Patrol Lead knows deathberries when she sees her and slips back to camp to report it to the leader - the warriors will need to be told to avoid this bush.
It takes little intelligence to recognize deathberries but a great deal to collect him anyway. If Stat Cat can dry him out, these berries will be sufficient for c_n for years to come. By using his weight to snap off one of the bush's branches and then carefully carrying it back to camp, Stat Cat manages to bring him safely home.

While Patrol Lead thinks she's <i>probably</i> cranberries, she isn't confident enough with the identification to risk being wrong and plucking deathberries instead.
While plucking her from the bush, Patrol Lead feels one of the berries split in her mouth, and a deceptively good taste coats her tongue. These aren't raspberries.

As she starts back to camp, however, she wobbles a bit, and the world goes dark. Her body is found soon after, but it's already too late to help.
One Paw carefully plucks the delicious-tasting berries, and as soon as the deceptive taste hits her tongue, she realizes she's made a terrible mistake. Trying to force themself to vomit and staggering weakly, she crawls back to camp, weakly hoping her mentor will help her.

Success
Better to have tansy, so good for all coughs, stocked up in abundance before leaf-bare hits.
Good for all coughs, all wounds, and all poisons, but it would be dangerous to assume tansy has no downsides. In small doses, it does help with nearly any ailment... but in <i>large</i> doses, it poisons the body, even to the point of causing death.

One Paw shovels tansy into her mouth without any cares in the world. Patrol Lead stops her, and tells her she really <i>should</i> have a care.

Stop that. Tansy isn't mallow or dandelion, to be played with by kits. In high concentrations or potency, it can kill the elderly, pregnant, or compromised, and it will <i>definitely</i> make One Paw sick if she doesn't respect it.

Patrol Lead spends so much time lecturing One Paw on the dangers of tansy that she endsup failing to collect any of the stars-damned stuff.
Patrol Lead wanders off to do her own collecting. However, leaving the apprentice alone is a mistake. It takes a <i>lot</i> of tansy to poison a cat, but One Paw was trying <i>very</i> hard to collect as much as possible.

Listen to the wisdom of the sages, Patrol Lead meows. One Paw doesn't just need to learn to set bones and clean wounds, being a medicine cat is so much more than blood and bodies.
-
Success
Some sicknesses aren't physical, but live in the mind instead, Patrol Lead instructs. That's very normal, and just as a Clanmate with a twisted leg is just as loved and valued as one who can run without pain, an illness that is mental is just as valid of a struggle, the cats just as loved and supported in their needs.

The strengthening newleaf sun has tempted fat burdock leaves to start to sprout, and it's not finding them that's hard, it's trying to carry the roots back to camp all at once that proves difficult! One Paw actually topples over at one point, although Patrol Lead pretends she didn't see, hiding her smile.
Luck is on Patrol Lead's side today - the burdock is both plentiful and easy to find. Laying the fat roots out in a towering but neat pile in the herb stores makes Patrol Lead's entire body thrum with a contented purr, as does seeing how hard One Paw is working to learn herbcraft.
Stat Cat shows his usual talent for spotting herbs, trotting straight over to a burdock plant and digging at its foot. One Paw asks her about it, and Patrol Lead replies with an explanation of how the distinctive size and shape of burdock leaves helps to quickly identify them from a distance.

Fail
Maybe she's just coming down with a runny nose, but Patrol Lead doesn't manage to sniff out any burdock, and it feels like a wasted afternoon. She avoids snapping at One Paw, who seems unable to identify the common herb, but she definitely come close.

bch_med_gatheringcatmint_newleaf1

Patrol Lead tests the air, trying to decide it it's warm enough to gather catmint yet. She'd really like to replenish the herb stocks after leaf-bare.
-
Success
The medicine cat carefully picks out catmint from its known hiding places, carrying it back to camp where it will protect the Clan.
Fortunately, catmint starts trying to take over as much ground as possible as soon as it possibly can, and it's already enough of the way through newleaf to go harvest from its young leaves.
Stat Cat has a few favorite catmint plants, and goes to check whether they've regrown this newleaf. Two haven't, but another two have, and they're enough for a great harvest to take back to camp.

bch_med_gatheringcatmint_newleaf2

Patrol Lead waits until she's out of camp to reveal to One Paw that she's off to find catmint - a 'helpful' group of 'helpers' can be a little, well, unhelpful. Catmint is just too exciting for many of her Clanmates to keep her heads around.

As she walks, Patrol Lead teaches One Paw about how crucial catmint is for coughs, and how, although its scent holds drugged pleasure, part of the responsibility of being a medicine cat is avoiding becoming caught in its haze. The medicine cats carefully pick out catmint from its known hiding places, carrying it back to camp where it will protect the Clan.
Fortunately, catmint starts trying to take over as much ground as possible as soon as it possibly can, and it's already enough of the way through newleaf to go harvest from its young leaves. Patrol Lead instructs One Paw in how one judges these things, to try and promote the most growth from the precious plant while still bringing home the greatest harvest.

As Patrol Lead looks at the twitching tails and wide eyes of the patrol set up to 'help' she gathers catmint, her heart sinks. These overly excited warriors don't look like she's going to be useful, and Patrol Lead really needs to renew c_n's stocks of catmint as newleaf brings the plants back to life.

Fortunately, catmint starts trying to take over as much ground as possible as soon as it possibly can, and it's already enough of the way through newleaf to go harvest from its young leaves. The patrol of warriors, while over-enthusiastic, calm her down when Patrol Lead demands her attention, and together the cats bring a fair harvest home.
Stat Cat has a few favorite catmint plants, and goes to check whether he's regrown this newleaf. Two haven't, but another two have, and he's enough for a great harvest to take back to camp, though the warriors are fairly unruly about the 'no rolling on the plants' rule.
-
Fail
Patrol Lead is proven unfortunately correct, as the patrol is full of juvenile behavior and dumb jokes, rather than focused effort. The one catmint plant she successfully find ends up with her helpers rolling around in it, bruising all the stems until it's unharvestable, and Patrol Lead is furious by the time she returns to camp.

The strengthening sun in the sky will bring dandelion plants out - always the first to take advantage of newleaf, those ones. Patrol Lead heads out to look for them.
-
Success
Truly, dandelions are an essential herb to keep in stock, crucial for poison and stings. The white milk in their roots and stems keeps for a long time, and it's a potent cure for poison - their leaves are weaker, but fast-acting, and can be chewed into poultices. Even the fluffy dandelion heads are useful as a c_n kitten's favorite, short-lived toy.
It's a successful gathering mission, with Patrol Lead striding back to camp with a great haul of whole, intact dandelion plants. Later, they'll sort the leaves and roots to be stored separately - the leaves remain fresh for a far shorter time.
With warmth in the air and ground, Stat Cat doesn't need to try very hard to find an excellent haul of dandelions to bring back to camp.

It's at least a little funny, how elder leaves are so suited for easing the pains of the Clan's elders. The tree isn't named for that - there's an old myth about a medicine cat asking an ancient tree for advice - but sometimes the coincidence amuses Patrol Lead.

As they lift their muzzles to try and catch mallow's sweet scent on the wind, Patrol Lead asks the patrol if they know how the herb got its name.

Mallow has a very literal name - it mellows things out, helping calm both the gut and the respiratory system. Perhaps it's not the most powerful herb in their arsenal, but it's excellent at helping in combination with others.

Try as they might, no one can sniff out any mallow, and the cats return to camp empty-pawed.

Once upon a time there was a plant that, unusually, loved not the midday sun's strength, but the sunset's quiet beauty. When it came time to bloom itself, it chose those colors, locking in just a hint of the sunset's warmth into itself. When we use marigold to treat stiff joints, that warmth is gifted to our patients.

With the drizzle hiding scents, One Paw almost walks straight past the thyme plant - but Patrol Lead gently herds her back, making sure the young cat understands the visual signs of the plant so she avoids that mistake in the future.
It calms racing hearts and minds, bringing cats back from the shock of loss or injury... Thyme is always both helpful and pleasant to have around, and Patrol Lead makes sure to organize the herb stores so that the scent wafts near the nests she and One Paw curl up in at night.
Thyme, thyme, thyme, there's never enough thyme. Stat Cat snorts at his little joke, putting down the herbs he carries to explain it to One Paw.

Fail
Patrol Lead has no time - and no thyme. They're forced to give up on the search for today.

With the newleaf sun hidden behind cloudy drizzle, it's a damp day to find thyme, and the gathering patrol would rather have this over with quickly.
-
Success
With the drizzle hiding scents, Patrol Lead almost walks straight past the thyme plant - but one of the warriors calls her over. Thanks to its calming, well-loved scent, medicine cats aren't the only Clan cats who can identify this plant, a fact that Patrol Lead is grateful for right about now.
It calms racing hearts and minds, bringing cats back from the shock of loss or injury... Thyme is always both helpful and pleasant to have around, and Patrol Lead decides that this patrol has brought back so much there's no harm in letting the warriors take a stem each for their nests.

bch_med_newleaf_thyme_risingclanref_storylorehealerlocked1

Listen to the wisdom of the sages, Patrol Lead meows. One Paw doesn't just need to learn to set bones and clean wounds, being a medicine cat is so much more than blood and bodies.
-
Success
Some sicknesses aren't physical, but live in the mind instead, Patrol Lead instructs. That's very normal, and just as a Clanmate with a twisted leg is just as loved and valued as one who can run without pain, an illness that is mental is just as valid of a struggle, the cats just as loved and supported in their needs.
-
Fail
One Paw feels overwhelmed with the responsibility of supporting Clanmates going through mental struggles - physical fights are so much simpler to support them with. Patrol Lead halts the lesson to comfort her.

Patrol Lead uses the blustery newleaf morning to try catch the scent of wild garlic on the breeze.
-
Success
The sharp tang of garlic leads Patrol Lead to a growing patch to bring home.
The leaves, and especially the bulbs, of wild garlic are the preeminent herb to treat infection, even if using them results each time in either her patient or their loved ones complaining about the smell. Patrol Lead, personally, will take a bit of a bad smell over illness, thank you very much.
Stat Cat, ever eagle-eyed, spots grass that looks suspiciously tall with oddly thick blades. One sniff confirms it as wild garlic, and this patch has heaps to harvest.
-
Fail
Try as she might, Patrol Lead can't quite remember the exact shape of the garlic leaves, and she isn't going to harvest from plants she hasn't confidently identified. Better safe than sorry, as they say...

One Paw listens carefully as Patrol Lead explains where to find the best prey in the rich waters of the pools.
One Paw picks up the instruction quickly and is soon hopping from pool to pool, picking out the tasty morsels from them.
By the end of the patrol, Stat Cat is easily fishing fresh-kill out of the pools without an ounce of hesitation in his movements.

Fail
One Paw tries to remember the differences between the creatures within the pools but fails to retain any of the information.
Stat Cat struggles to take the lesson seriously, and eventually the training session ends early with no real progress made.

bch_train_stuck1

Trailing behind the patrol, the dune he's crossing shifts beneath Random's paws. He looks around wildly for safe footing - just as the sand caves in beneath him and the world goes dark.

Success
His Clanmates come running at his yowls, and Random is soon freed, shaken but unharmed. The patrol settles down as everyone comforts each other.
Patrol Lead digs through the sand, helping Random clear it away enough for the other cat to scramble free.
Without letting he panic, Stat Cat carefully assesses the collapsed dune trapping his Clanmate. He points out stable footing for the patrol to dig him out from above, and Random is recovered, scared but okay.
Creeping in as close as possible, Stat Cat purrs to his Clanmate, keeping him calm as the patrol carefully digs down to him.
-
Fail
The patrol works all day to free Random and gets nothing else done.
As Stat Cat rarely has patience for other cats, he tells Random harshly that he doesn't have time for some mouse-brain who got stuck, making Random resentful as he digs him out of the sand.
Hurt and wheezing, Random hears the patrol panicking as he drifts to StarClan.
The patrol eventually manages to rescue Random, but he needs to be helped back to camp, battered and injured.
The patrol can't help Random in time, and as Random starts to drift off to StarClan, the eyes of Stat Cat glint malevolently. Was this...? Random doesn't have a chance to finish his last thought.
Even though Random made it out, he swears someone pushed him, and blames Stat Cat. Stat Cat denies it and says they should get Random back to camp to get his injury looked at.

Random is training alone out on the coast when suddenly, the dune he's standing on shifts beneath his paws. He looks around wildly for safe footing - just as the sand caves in beneath him and the world goes dark.
-
Success
Random spends the entire day carefully working his way free and gets nothing else done, but at least he's unharmed.
Stat Cat tries to remain calm, clawing sand away from his muzzle so he can breathe. As the shock wears off, he realizes the sand seems thinner on one side of his body. With a surge of energy, he bursts through the weak point, terrified and caked in damp sand. He may have a new nightmare to take back with him, but at least he's alive.
-
Fail
Random tries his best, but unfortunately, he's only able to work his head free. He yowl until his voice is hoarse and his throat is sore, and a patrol passes by after sunhigh has come and gone to free their hapless Clanmate.
Hurt and wheezing, Random does his best to hang on and wait for a patrol, but he succumbs to his injuries and drifts to StarClan alone.
Random eventually manages to pull himself free, but he's wheezing and injured. It's all he can do to find some beach grass to shelter in through the night out on the shore, until a patrol finds him the next morning and helps him to the medicine den.

As One Paw watches the octopus contort itself, more liquid than animal, she can see how it could be a sea cat.

Two Paw picks his way up the cliff path, asking what One Paw wanted to show him. One Paw brings him to a point where the wind hits the land, and Two Paw gasps, watching the gigantic waves breaking against the cliff. It's thrilling, a little scary, and very cool.
When Two Paw arrives, One Paw shows him the spot she's found, where the apprentices can see the gigantic storm waves breaking against the land.

Two Paw rounds the top of the cliff and sees Stat Cat, asking why Stat Cat wanted to meet there. Stuttering but determined, Stat Cat explains that he wondered if, possibly, maybe, Two Paw would like to hang out... just the two of them?

Random goes through his tricks, showing Patrol Lead how he uses the direction of the sun to avoid casting a shadow on pools as he fishes. Patrol Lead watches with eyes that Random notices are a bit too admiring for what's just a little trick. He smirks, showing off a little.
It's a long but satisfying training session, and both cats have ample opportunity to test themselves and work on their skills. It ends with them both sitting on a little outlook, watching the sun go down and catching the last of its rays on their pelts. Random sees Patrol Lead watching him instead of the sun and smiles.
Stat Cat is a fantastic hunter, and Patrol Lead isn't shy about telling her so. He blushes but works through it, showing Patrol Lead how to use the scraps of old crowfood from the fresh-kill pile to attract crabs and fish in the rockpools out of their hidey-holes.

As Patrol Lead and Random wander across the beach with only the stars to light their way, they notice sparkles of light where the waves break upon the shore.

Success
Random pokes curiously at one of the little lights, bringing his face down to it. It's a tiny crab, less than the width of one of his claws! It fascinates him and Patrol Lead, and they spend hours on the beach, lapping up mouthfuls of light crabs and crushing them between their teeth, laughing with each other as their mouths start glowing too.
Stunned, the cats sit back and watch as the waves bring ripples of light. It's a breathless, magical scene, and Random leans against Patrol Lead, their pelts keeping each other warm as they take in the magic of the sea.
As they watch, quiet and patient, more and more of the sea starts to come alive with tiny, glittering creatures dancing around in the water. With no words other than the occasional quiet gasp, Patrol Lead and Stat Cat spend hours watching the magic of the sea swirl, dip, and undulate, their hearts full of wonder.

-
Success
Random shows her a stunningly successful move he's been working on to rapidly change directions in deep dry sand, and Patrol Lead can't let herself look bad in comparison, showing off her battle-backflip with a smug smirk.
Random shows off how far he can pounce, so Patrol Lead shows off how fast she can run, so Random shows off how sharp his claws are, so Patrol Lead shows off how shiny her pelt is, so Random shows off how long his legs are, so Patrol Lead shows off how cool her scars are - this goes on all afternoon.

Patrol Lead tells a mournful and haunting tale of all the cats that were swept out to sea and drowned before the dolphins took pity on one of them. The tiny white and red cat that was saved made the first traditions and bonds with the dolphins, and both the Clan and the dolphins wept at their death when it came.
Patrol Lead tells the apprentices about the red and white cat that was saved by the dolphins. They managed to keep afloat long enough for them to be saved by relaxing their entire body and floating on the waves.

-
Success
They slipped into the ocean to feed their Clan, again and again, and each time they had to leave the water their heart broke a little more. Eventually, they didn't leave at all. Their fur grew fluffy and buoyant, and now the sea otter floats, happy and fulfilled with the oceanic world.

bch_train_foxdawn_lorelocked1

Patrol Lead notices One Paw fall awkwardly again and calls a halt to the lesson, saying they all need to catch their breath. Instead, Patrol Lead will tell the apprentices about the Fox Warrior - have they heard this piece of Clan history?
-
Success
The fox warrior was not the biggest, or fastest, or strongest of his Clan. A fox took his eye, a dog weakened his leg, and frostbite almost took his life, yet he took them all without a flinch, never backing down. His only wish was to shield his Clan. Some say he still sneaks down from StarClan to defend c_n on occasion - a true warrior, never forgotten.
-
Fail
One Paw can't sit still and listen to Patrol Lead's story, not when her ego's smarting from her failures. Patrol Lead doesn't push it, instead letting One Paw go and run off her energy - there'll be time enough for listening another day, and One Paw's persistence is as fox warrior-like as anyone could wish.

bch_train_mauifishing_storylocked1

After a fishing lesson, the apprentices look soggy and sorry for themselves. Patrol Lead waves her tail to suggest they stop for a moment and take a break. After all, even Maowi had to work hard to fish!
-
Success
The great legend Maowi was once a young apprentice, Patrol Lead starts the story, who went out fishing with his older, already grown siblings. They had no faith in him, but speaking a great karakia to give StarClan's blessing to his claws, he won a stingray from the ocean that stretched from horizon to horizon and became c_n's territory.
-
Fail
Patrol Lead tries to start a story to entertain the apprentices, but they're tired and sullen, and don't appreciate being told of the magical fishing talents of a Stars-blessed cat when they're finding it so hard to learn themselves.

bch_train_mauislowingthesun_storylocked1

The sun splashes orange, yellow, and gold across the sea where it meets the horizon. The seagulls call in the distance, rising on the last thermals of the day, as Patrol Lead begins the myth of How Maowi Slowed The Sun.
-
Success
Once, the sun raced across the sky, each day only lasting a single catnap. The great Maowi, alongside his siblings, said a karakia to StarClan to ask for their help in fighting the sun. They pinned the great flaming sun in a burrow, clawing at it until it gave in and promised to slow, and this is why the sun gives up its race in leaf-bare and slows the day, bringing greenleaf.
-
Fail
Patrol Lead gets distracted by the glory of the sunset and loses the words she was forming. Ah well.

bch_train_themoonandthetides_storylorelocked1

The heartbeat of the tides, in and out like breathing, might at first seem connected to the spirit of the land, Patrol Lead says. But that's wrong.
-
Success
Though they wash over the land, the tides are connected to the moon, Patrol Lead meows. At night this becomes obvious - the new moon and the full moon both produce spring tides of unusual strength. And every so often, if the moon is displeased, a spring tide gains twice the height and strength, producing a king tide.
-
Fail
Learning about the tides is boring - shoving each other into the water, now <i>that's</i> training! Patrol Lead is not pleased.

bch_train_romantic_oceanswim1

Patrol Lead suggests to Random that it is the perfect weather to go for a swim in the ocean together.
-
Success
Patrol Lead flashes Random a playful look and leaps smoothly into the water. When Patrol Lead emerges from the water, her slicked fur clinging to her muscles, Random can't help but admire Patrol Lead for her strength. With the way Random's heart is fluttering, it may not just be Patrol Lead's strength he admires. He brushes it aside and plunge in after her.
Silence meets her question, and just as Patrol Lead is about to turn and ask again, Random shoves her into the water. Spluttering from the cold saltwater, Patrol Lead finds it quite difficult to scowl as though she means it, captivated by the sound of Random's joyous laughter, the sunlight catching on his pelt in just the right way.
-
Fail
Random dips one paw in the water and hisses, proclaiming that it's much too cold and urging Patrol Lead to come back to camp with him instead.
Stat Cat tries his best to show off his swimming skills, but his companion just isn't paying attention, too focused on his own swimming to notice. Eventually, Stat Cat gives up for now, discouraged.

bch_train_eagle_greenleafdappledfeather1

One Paw notices Two Paw's absence and follows his unobscured trail to the cliff's edge. What in the seven seas is Two Paw doing out here? There's an eagle nest, Two Paw explains, his tail swooping up over his back to point - look, the chicks are trying to fly!
-
Success
Wait, like, eagle apprentices? Intrigued, One Paw sticks her head out. Down below, two dappled feathered juveniles squabble, beating their wings frantically, clearly gearing up for something. Two Paw bets on the lighter colored one, but One Paw thinks that the smaller dark patterned one has the heart for it, and she leaps to her paws when the darker chick takes to the wing first, throwing her head back and yowling cheers to the sky as the little eagle makes it to the next tree over.
One Paw has never seen those before! She edges over beside Two Paw, both apprentices staring down at the eagle nest in the tree below them, calling down advice. No, beat their wings harder! Harder! They can do it!
-
Fail
It's not One Paw's thing, but she's happy to bask a couple tail-lengths away until Two Paw is done eagle watching.
Stat Cat crowds forward, daringly letting his paws dangle over the edge as he looks at the chicks - and the ground crumbles. Both apprentices flinch backwards with yelps and yowls, but Stat Cat is too close, on too unstable ground, and he feels himself losing his grip. His heart jumps with terror as sudden pain sparks down his flank. The other apprentice digs fangs into Stat Cat's side, saving his life, if not his pelt.

bch_train_greenleaf_twolegmigration_lorelocked1

Patrol Lead leads the patrol out to a promontory of rock, pointing out the Twoleg monsters crowding the sandy shoreline below as they twinkle in the sunlight.
-
Success
This is the history Patrol Lead is here to teach - every greenleaf, the Twolegs come to this beach, a great migration in their monsters. They swim in this bay, and occasionally the bays to either side, but no more than that, a constrained invasion. Leave them to their rituals. c_n will return to this beach when the seasons change.
-
Fail
The monsters unnerve the patrol, who don't want to stick around to hear Patrol Lead's lesson. Patrol Lead disapproves, but lets the patrol end early.

bch_train_greenleaf_dryhot1

This is just oppressive. The sand burns the patrols paws as they dart from one refuge of dune-bursh to another, the distant training grounds they were supposed to go to looking more and more out of reach.
-
Success
They all stagger towards the nearest rockpool and flop into it, not hunting, purely there for the water and damp coats. Random swipes water towards Patrol Lead and she laughes, welcoming it and returning the favour. There's nothing like swimming in greenleaf, and the patrol devolves into a waterfight.

-
Fail
It's a long walk home, and not a pleasent one. They probably should have drunk more water before going out to train. Or not gone out at all.

bch_train_leafbare_icebergmyth_storylocked1

A winter gale howls outside camp - today's apprentice lesson will occur in the shelter of the den. Patrol Lead gathers her audience close. On the longest night of leafbare, if a cat is unlucky, they might spot great white islands appearing out of the sea-mist.
-
Success
Those who see it are called, like a riptide sucking them out of reach, Patrol Lead whispers. None who step foot on the white mist islands are ever seen again... The group shivers with pleasant fear in the warmth of their sheltered nests.
-
Fail
The winds of the gale drown out Patrol Lead's voice. Instead, the cats give up on storytelling and cuddle together into a ball, watertight against the world.

bch_train_leafbare_stormfables_storylorelocked1

The waves crash outside camp, an ever present noise brought into sharp focus by their unusual power and ferocity. The wind is blocked by camp walls, but Patrol Lead's Clanmates have their fur puffed out regardless. Now isn't a good time to leave shelter.
-
Success
Let us speak of the nursery tales, Stat Cat begins. Of Clans founded amid driftwood and loss, of the moon giving her blessing to warriors who swim under her gaze, of the magic of the sea, currently awful, but just as much awe inspiring. Outside it rages - but here in camp, c_n is safe.
This day will be a day of heroes, Stat Cat whispers, capturing their Clanmates' attention. Heroes born, or made, or found - such things always appear in c_n's history, a stranger arriving soaked from a storm, a new life brought into the world as winds howl outside, a warrior rising to need. The storms mark it.
-
Fail
Thunder cracks and the wind shifts, throwing ocean spray from the waves on the gathered cats. Time to retreat to drier locations.

bch_train_lore1

Patrol Lead takes the patrol down to the beach to train, but wait, something's odd here...
-
Success
Random explains that the sea has always given mysterious gifts to c_n and that those strange ginger cat statues are probably just another gift from the ocean... Probably.
The strange ginger cat statues seem to be purring slightly. Random suggests they leave the beach as soon as possible; those things don't seem... entirely of this world.
Stat Cat laughs! The ginger cat statues are Twoleg objects; he spins a tale almost unbelievable, but he swears it's true! The ginger cat statues used to live on something called a 'boat.'
Those ginger cat statues? Stat Cat heard a kittypet call him Garfield. Stat Cat explains that, for whatever reason, Twolegs worship the ginger cat so much that they made statues they throw into the ocean.
-
Fail
There is no way Random is staying around here. He tears off back to camp at the sight of a broken ginger cat statue.
The whole patrol agrees this beach is abandoned by StarClan. There's no way so many broken ginger cat statues are here naturally, and well, Stat Cat has always been a little odd...
-

bch_train_lore2

Patrol Lead decides to go down to the beach by herself. There seems to be something strange here...
-
Success
Patrol Lead is shocked to find green and black lizards scattered around the beach. She freezes, trying not to get bit. When nothing moves, she heads back to camp unscathed.
Green and black lizards are everywhere! Patrol Lead freezes up, only to notice that they're not moving and some of them stick straight up. They're not real! She takes a fake lizard home to show the others.
There are green and black lizards! Stat Cat realizes they're not real immediately and decides to come back to this location to collect fake lizards for future pranks on Clanmates.
Stat Cat remembers seeing these green and black lizards being shown to him by a kittypet before, who called them 'lego dragons'. Stat Cat wonders if Legodragon would be a proper name for a warrior.
-
Fail
It's a beach full of lizards! Patrol Lead tears back to camp before she can get bitten.

bch_train_leaffall_lifeguarding_storyloreswimmerlocked1

The large patrol practices holding another cat's head above the water, using the calm (but <i>very</i> chilly) waters of a rock pool. One Paw shivers, despite being huddled with Patrol Lead. Why couldn't she practice this on a hot sunny day?
-
Success
Stat Cat sits on the windward side of One Paw, trying to give her a little more shelter. It's understandable, he sympathises, but One Paw can't rely on cats in distress only showing up with the sea is inviting. The sympathy (and a little physical warmth) put cheer back into One Paw, and she takes her next turn at life guarding practice with enthusiasm.
Stat Cat nods. Life guarding isn't easy, even in practice. But they offer up the story of a kitten saved by a c_n warrior, who had the strenght and will to keep the little ball of fur above the waves under nearly impossible circumstances. It makes One Paw sit up straight, proud to be carrying on that tradition.
Doesn't One Paw want to be an ocean dancer, one of the many cats in c_n's ancestry who managed to master the waves, streaking in and out in to save lives that have been lost to the ocean's jaws, Stat Cat asks? And well, when he puts it like <i>that</i>... One Paw's motivation returns.
-
Fail
Learning the art of water rescue is important, of course, but safety comes first. One Paw has her pelt licked dry and warm again, and the patrol is called off early.
One Paw is right - this is far, far too cold of a pool to train in, and they're shivering too badly to continue. Time to go home, and Patrol Lead apologises for bringing the patrol out here.

bch_train_elephantseal1

As the sun creeps over the horizon, Patrol Lead leads the patrol carefully towards a familiar beach, stopping the cats on the clifftop. Below them, the sand is hidden under a mass of boulders, as long as twenty cats and as wide as ten.
-
Success
As the cats watch, the silence is broken when one of the massive boulders rears up and snorts. One Paw's fur stands on end and Two Paw looks seconds away from fleeing, but Patrol Lead flicks her tail encouragingly. These are nosy-seals, she explains, and the beach full of 'boulders' suddenly seems far more intimidating, but less disturbing.
One Paw and Two Paw's jaws drop in disbelief when Patrol Lead explains these are animals, not a rockslide. They stare as a nosy-seal wakes from his slumber and bellows a challenge to his neighbor, flinching as the monolithic animals crash towards each other. Each drips enough blood to fill the veins of an entire cat, crashing and careening off each other.
As the 'rocks' wake and reveal themselves to be the most massive animals One Paw and Two Paw have ever seen, Stat Cat reassures them - they may never have seen these frightening seals before, but c_n has. Stat Cat spends the morning quizzing the apprentices until each is able to identify a male nosy-seal with his trunk versus the comparatively smaller females.
As the sun hits them and the massive boulders wake with grumbling snorts, One Paw and Two Paw both look about to run. Stat Cat quickly calms them, explaining that these massive yearly visitors to c_n are nosy-seals and that if the cats don't bother them, they won't bother the cats.
-
Fail
When one of the boulders abruptly starts roaring, One Paw shrieks and bolts. It takes the rest of the patrol to find her, and the teaching moment is forgotten as the cats gather to comfort her.

bch_train_newleaf_keepyourfooting_loreteacherswimmerrunnerlocked1

One Paw doesn't understand what 'footing' training is supposed to mean. she knows how to <i>walk</i>. What're they <i>really</i> here to train?
-
Success
Stat Cat rolls his eyes. Yes, they <i>are</i> really here to walk and run and jump around the rockpools. It rained last night, and the rock is slippery, so these are perfect conditions. Stat Cat tells the tale of a kit once saved by a warrior sprinting along the rocks in a storm, as One Paw falls over and skids harmlessly into a pool.
Stat Cat chides One Paw for her skepticism. Rock scrambling is its own art form, in c_n's territory. What if One Paw needs to cross an exposed area during a storm, or if a battle between clans occurred in the tide pools? One Paw concedes and pays attention as Stat Cat teaches, gaining sure-footed confidence that will serve her well.
Stat Cat laughs. No, they're here for something way cooler - literally. Wetter, too. Here the rock pools are of deceptively different depths, so Stat Cat's going to teach One Paw how to judge which ones are deep enough to dive into and which ones won't even get her belly fur wet.
If One Paw thinks she knows how to walk on the rocks, she'll} have to prove it - and catch Stat Cat. One Paw scrambles after him, around and around the slick rocks. But Stat Cat is always a fox-length away, taunting and encouraging by turns, and One Paw is left panting, exhausted, and admiring.
-
Fail
In her haste to prove she needs no lessons on rock scrambling, One Paw... miscalculates. Patrol Lead hauls her from the rockpool by the scruff, hoping the fall will make the lesson stick when her teaching couldn't.
