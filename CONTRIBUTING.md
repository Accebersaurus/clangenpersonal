# Contributing
Thank you for your interest in contributing to Clangen!

If you would like to contribute writing, art, or a major gameplay feature, please apply for a developer role on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rnFQqyPZ7K). This is so that we can better coordinate the style and overall direction of the game.

For quality-of-life changes, bug fixes, minor enhancements (such as balance and customization), or any open issues, feel free to make a Pull Request. You do not have to be on the Discord or have a developer role on the Discord to submit a Pull Request.

### Solving an Issue

If you do not know where to get started, check the [good first issue tag](https://github.com/ClanGenOfficial/clangen/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). These issues have been marked as “good first issues” because they are non-urgent improvements that do not require a great familiarity with the larger codebase. Solving these issues is a great way to better understand the codebase.
