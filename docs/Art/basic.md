New art contributors are highly encouraged to join the discord in order to collaborate more directly with the art team.

[Applications](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfA2OdlRguAgtykohFaJ2Jth6GcxupnKKbir9-bINahZkKnug/viewform) are available for artists seeking to join the project as an apprentice developer. If accepted, apprentice devs are able to seek direct guidance from other contributors and senior developers; as well as collaborate with coders to have their art added to the project.

Pull Requests are still welcome from everyone: whether new to the project, accepted as an apprentice dev, or an established contributor. 

!!! info "Remember"
    Our priority when adding new art is to keep a consistent art style and quality level. If PR'd art has not received critique and feedback via the developer discord channels, then it is highly likely to receive critique during the PR review process.
